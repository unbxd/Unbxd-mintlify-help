Attributes include:

1. Location – Segment shoppers by region for localized recommendations.
2. Device – Identify shopping behavior across mobile, desktop, or tablet.
3. Visit Type – Distinguish between first-time and returning visitors to tailor experiences.
4. Custom Attributes – Use business-specific criteria to create unique shopper segments.

### Types of Segment Attributes in Unbxd

Segment attributes classify shoppers based on different criteria for personalization.

1. **Default Attributes** – Built-in attributes such as location, device, and visit type that help segment shoppers based on standard data points.
2. **Custom Attributes** – User-defined attributes passed through the search API to create segments based on specific business needs.

#### Default Attributes in Unbxd

Default attributes are _predefined_ segmentation criteria available in the Unbxd platform. These attributes help categorize shoppers based on common factors without additional configuration.

Description of Default Attribute: Default attributes simplify segmentation, allowing for quick personalization without custom setup.

#### Custom attributes in Unbxd

You can add up to five custom attributes in addition to the default ones per segment.

| Attribute           | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loyalty Tier        | Segment shoppers as "Gold," "Silver," or "Bronze" members to offer exclusive discounts.           |
| Purchase Frequency  | Identify frequent buyers to provide personalized promotions or early access to sales.             |
| Product Preferences | Categorize shoppers based on interest in specific brands or categories to refine recommendations. |

### Segmentation selection by Unbxd

\
Priority order is critical in order to resolve the conflict between the different segments.\
The priority order of selecting a segment in one or more matching attributes is available between two segments.

1. Unbxd Default: Location
2. Unbxd Default: Device Type
3. Unbxd Default: Visit Type

### Use Case:

A segment is created for Spain (location) with the name **Spain_users**. Another segment is exclusively meant for New Shoppers with the name **New\_**[\*\*Shoppers. \*\*](http://Shoppers.In)If a new shopper comes from Spain, both segments will be applicable.

**Question**: which segment should be chosen by Unbxd?\
\
**Solution**: Unbxd will resolve the issue based on the priority of the segmentable attributes configured by the user. \
Unbxd Default Location is ranked above Unbxd Default visit type, so in the above use case, \*\*Spain_users \*\*segmentation will be applied.
