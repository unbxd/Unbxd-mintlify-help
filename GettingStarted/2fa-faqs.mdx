### Q. What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), and why is it required?

**A.** 2FA adds a second layer of security to your account. It combines your password with a 6-digit code from an authenticator app, helping protect your account from unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

---

### Q. Who can enable or enforce 2FA?

**A.** Only the **Account Owner/Admin** can enable or disable 2FA for the entire account. Once enabled, all users must complete the 2FA setup during their next login.

---

### Q. Can individual users enable 2FA themselves?

**A.** No. In Unbxd Netcore, individual users cannot enable 2FA independently. It must be enforced at the account level by an admin.

---

### Q. What happens if I lose my phone or can't access the authenticator app?

**A.** Use one of the **backup codes** provided during setup to log in. Each code is single-use, so make sure to store them securely.

If you donâ€™t have access to backup codes, ask your **Account Admin** to reset your 2FA setup.

---

### Q. How do I use a backup code?

**A.** On the 2FA screen, click **Use Backup Code** and enter any unused backup code. You'll gain access to your account if the code is valid.

---

### Q. Can I disable 2FA?

**A.** If 2FA is enforced at the account level, you **cannot disable** it yourself. 

_Only Account Owners/Admins can turn off account-level 2FA._

---

### Q. What if my backup codes are lost or used up?

**A.** If you've used all your backup codes and cannot access your authenticator app, contact your **Account Admin** to reset your 2FA.

---

### Q. What should I do if the 2FA setup fails?

**A.** If you encounter issues while scanning the QR code or entering the verification code:

- Ensure the time on your phone is set to automatic.
- Try manually entering the key displayed on-screen into your app.
- If problems persist, contact your **admin or Netcore support team**
