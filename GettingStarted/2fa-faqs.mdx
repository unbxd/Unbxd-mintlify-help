### Q. What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), and why is it required?

**A.** 2FA adds a second layer of security to your account. It combines your password with a 6-digit code from an authenticator app, helping protect your account from unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

---

### Q. Who can enable or enforce 2FA?

**A.** Only the **Account Owner/Admin** can enable or disable 2FA for the entire account. Once enabled, all users must complete the 2FA setup during their next login.

### Q. How do I change my 2FA device or switch to a new authenticator app?

**A.** You can update your 2FA device from your user profile. This is useful if you've changed phones or want to use a different authenticator app.

**Steps:**

1. Go to **My Profile** \>**Two-Factor Authentication ** section.
2. Enter your current **6-digit OTP** from your existing app to verify.
3. After verification, scan the new **QR code** with your new device/app.
4. Complete the setup and download your newly generated **backup codes**.

> Once updated, your previous authenticator app will stop working. Be sure to finish the setup fully.

### Q. What if I want to change my 2FA device but no longer have access to the old one?

**A.** If you’ve lost access to your previous device and cannot provide the current OTP to verify, you won’t be able to switch 2FA devices yourself.

You must contact your **Account Admin** to request a **2FA reset**. After the reset, you’ll be prompted to set up 2FA again during your next login.

---

### Q. Can individual users enable 2FA themselves?

**A.** No. In Unbxd Netcore, individual users cannot enable 2FA independently. It must be enforced at the account level by an admin.

---

### Q. What happens if I lose my phone or can't access the authenticator app?

**A.** Use one of the **backup codes** provided during setup to log in. Each code is single-use, so make sure to store them securely.

If you don’t have access to backup codes, ask your **Account Admin** to reset your 2FA setup.

---

### Q. I’ve used all my backup codes and lost access to my authenticator device.  How can I generate new backup codes?

**A.** If you no longer have access to your authenticator app and have exhausted all backup codes, you will **not be able to log in or regenerate new codes** on your own.

In this case, you must contact the **Netcore Support team** for assistance. They will help you **reset your 2FA configuration**, after which you can set up 2FA again and receive a new set of backup codes.

> **Tip:** Always download and securely store your backup codes immediately after setting up 2FA or switching authenticator apps.

### Q. How do I use a backup code?

**A.** On the 2FA screen, click **Use Backup Code** and enter any unused backup code. You'll gain access to your account if the code is valid.

---

### Q. Can I disable 2FA?

**A.** If 2FA is enforced at the account level, you **cannot disable** it yourself.

_Only Account Owners/Admins can turn off account-level 2FA._

---

### Q. What if my backup codes are lost or used up?

**A.** If you've used all your backup codes and cannot access your authenticator app, contact your **Account Admin** to reset your 2FA.

---

### Q. What should I do if the 2FA setup fails?

**A.** If you encounter issues while scanning the QR code or entering the verification code:

- Ensure the time on your phone is set to automatic.
- Try manually entering the key displayed on-screen into your app.
- If problems persist, contact your **admin or Netcore support team**
