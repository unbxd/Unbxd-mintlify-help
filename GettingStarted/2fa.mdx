# Overview

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is a critical security feature available in Unbxd Netcore that adds an extra layer of protection to your account. It requires two forms of identification before granting access to the platform.

In addition to your email and password, 2FA requires a time-based one-time password (OTP) generated by an authenticator app. This ensures that even if your login credentials are compromised, unauthorized access to your account is prevented.

2FA is especially important for securing and maintaining the integrity of your product discovery data and workflows.

Unbxd Netcore supports the following methods for 2FA:

- **App Code-Based Authentication:** A six-digit code is generated by an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy) and must be entered after your password during login.
- **Backup Codes:** A set of single-use recovery codes provided at the time of 2FA setup. These can be used when you donâ€™t have access to your authenticator device. Each code can be used only once and should be stored securely.
