**Two-Factor Authentication** is a critical security feature now available for Netcore CE. This adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring two forms of identification before granting access.

In addition to your username and password, 2FA requires a code from an authenticator app or sent to your email as a one-time password (OTP). This ensures that unauthorized access is prevented even if your password is compromised.
