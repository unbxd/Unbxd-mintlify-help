### **Release date:**

### 1. Vector Search for Smarter Product Discovery

We are excited to announce the release of **Vector Search**, a powerful AI-enabled feature designed to make product discovery more intuitive and accurate for shoppers on your eCommerce platform.

Unlike traditional keyword-based search, Vector Search understands the **intent** behind a user’s query and delivers results that match the **meaning**, not just the exact words.

- **Vector Search**: Uses machine learning to understand semantic relationships between user queries and product data.
- **Hybrid Search Mode**: Combines keyword-based results with semantically relevant results to enhance result quality.
- **Fallback Search Mode**: Automatically activates Vector Search when traditional search shows limited or no results.

### 2. Measurement Search

**Measurement Search** is a new AI-powered search enhancement in the Unbxd platform that allows shoppers to find products based on specific, measurable dimensions such as **size, weight, price, or pressure**.

This feature supports more precise and intuitive search experiences for end users, especially for dimension-driven product categories like **fashion, furniture, appliances, and hardware**.

### 3. AI Metadata for Enhanced Search Precision

**AI Metadata** is a powerful enhancement to the Unbxd Search platform that **automatically enriches your product catalog** by extracting key product attributes (such as color, material, fit, and style) using **Artificial Intelligence**.

Even if these attributes aren’t manually added to your catalog, AI Metadata can derive them from product titles, descriptions, and other content, ensuring your products appear accurately in search results and filters.

AI Metadata works in synergy with the following Unbxd AI Models:

| Model              | Function                                                                                                   |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Content Model**  | Analyzes catalog data to structure and enrich it using attributes like title, color, size, brand, etc.     |
| **Intent Model**   | Understands the shopper’s true intent, even in natural language queries like “ergonomic chair under $200”. |
| **Ranking Model**  | Scores products based on relevance, user engagement, and availability to determine result order.           |
| **Fallback Model** | Uses semantic understanding to return related results when exact matches are unavailable.                  |
