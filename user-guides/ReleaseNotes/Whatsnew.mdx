### Vector Search for Smarter Product Discovery

We are excited to announce the release of **Vector Search**, a powerful AI-enabled feature designed to make product discovery more intuitive and accurate for shoppers on your eCommerce platform.

Unlike traditional keyword-based search, Vector Search understands the **intent** behind a userâ€™s query and delivers results that match the **meaning**, not just the exact words.

- **Vector Search**: Uses machine learning to understand semantic relationships between user queries and product data.
- **Hybrid Search Mode**: Combines keyword-based results with semantically relevant results to enhance result quality.
- **Fallback Search Mode**: Automatically activates Vector Search when traditional search shows limited or no results.
