## V 1.22

### **Release date: April**

### 1. Vector Search for Smarter Product Discovery

We are excited to announce the release of **Vector Search**, a powerful AI-enabled feature designed to make product discovery more intuitive and accurate for shoppers on your eCommerce platform.

Unlike traditional keyword-based search, Vector Search understands the **intent** behind a user’s query and delivers results that match the **meaning**, not just the exact words.

- **Vector Search**: Uses machine learning to understand semantic relationships between user queries and product data.
- **Hybrid Search Mode**: Combines keyword-based results with semantically relevant results to enhance result quality.
- **Fallback Search Mode**: Automatically activates Vector Search when traditional search shows limited or no results.

For more information, refer to [Vector Search documentation](https://docs.netcoreunbxd.com/user-guides/merchandising/Algorithms/Intent/VectorSearch)

### 2. Measurement Search

**Measurement Search** is a new AI-powered search enhancement in the Unbxd platform that allows shoppers to find products based on specific, measurable dimensions such as **size, weight, price, or pressure**.

This feature supports more precise and intuitive search experiences for end users, especially for dimension-driven product categories like **fashion, furniture, appliances, and hardware**.

For more information, refer to [Measurement Search documentation](https://docs.netcoreunbxd.com/user-guides/merchandising/Algorithms/Intent/MeasurementSearch)

### 3. Website Preview for Enhanced Debugging Capabilities

**Website Preview** is a powerful enhancement to the Unbxd Search platform that **automatically enriches your product catalog** by extracting key product attributes (such as color, material, fit, and style) using **Artificial Intelligence**.

Even if these attributes aren’t manually added to your catalog, the preview functionality can derive them from product titles, descriptions, and other content, ensuring your products appear accurately in search results and filters.

This works in synergy with the following Unbxd AI Models:

| Model              | Function                                                                                                    |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Content Model**  | Analyzes catalog data to structure and enrich it using attributes like title, color, size, brand, etc.      |
| **Intent Model**   | Understands the shopper’s true intent, even in natural language queries like “ergonomic chair under \$200”. |
| **Ranking Model**  | Scores products based on relevance, user engagement, and availability to determine result order.            |
| **Fallback Model** | Uses semantic understanding to return related results when exact matches are unavailable.                   |

For more information, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.netcoreunbxd.com/user-guides/SearchPreview/AI-meta-data).

### 4. AI-Suggested Similar Queries

We are excited to announce **AI-Suggested Similar Queries** to help improve the shopper experience by surfacing relevant, intent-driven search suggestions.\
**What it does:**

- Recommends additional search terms and category-based suggestions based on past user behavior, search trends, and semantic understanding.
- Helps users refine their search, discover products faster, and significantly reduce zero-result queries.

**Example:**\
 If a user searches for **White Dresses**, the system might suggest related queries like **white dress**, **white shoes**, **white bag**, or **white sneakers**.For more information, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.netcoreunbxd.com/user-guides/merchandising/promotions/add-promotions#ai-suggested-queries).

### 5. Visual Search

We’re thrilled to announce the enhancement of **Visual Search** , a next-generation AI-driven feature that empowers shoppers to search for products using **images instead of text**.\
It has been significantly enhanced with improved capabilities and a refreshed user experience. This upgraded version delivers more accurate results, faster performance, and better integration, making it more powerful and intuitive than ever before.

**What it does?**

Using **Visual Search**, users can easily find a product even if they dont know the exact product names.

**Visual Search** allows users to:

- Upload an image or paste an image URL.
- Get real-time product recommendations that match visually with the input image.
- Interact with **image markers (dots)** to view similar items for specific products within a multi-item image (e.g., dress and shoes).

For more information, refer to the [Visual Search documentation](https://docs.netcoreunbxd.com/user-guides/SearchPreview/VisualSearch).

### 6. Product Card Viewer

We are pleased to announce the **General Availability of Product Card Viewer**, powerful visual tool that enables merchandisers and business teams to **preview how products will appear** to shoppers on **Search** and **Browse** pages.

This feature bridges the gap between data configuration and on-site presentation by **linking specific product attributes** (like title, price, and image) to how they are rendered in product listings.

**Why is it so important?**

The **Product Card Viewer** gives teams an at-a-glance preview of product listings directly in the Unbxd console. It ensures that **key product information is prominently displayed**, making merchandising more effective and product discovery smoother for shoppers.\
Refer the [Product Card Mapping documentation](https://docs.netcoreunbxd.com/user-guides/SearchPreview/ProductCardMapping) to learn more.

### 7. Bulk Export/Import Field Configurations

We are excited to announce the **General Availability** of the **Bulk Export/Import Field Configurations** feature. This new capability allows users to **export and import field configuration settings in bulk**, making catalog setup and management faster, more scalable, and less error-prone.

Whether you're working across multiple environments or updating field properties for large product catalogs, this feature simplifies the process and ensures consistency in your configuration strategy.
