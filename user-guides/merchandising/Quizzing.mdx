## Overview

The **Quiz** feature in your Search Console lets you create interactive quizzes that help personalize user experiences on your website or app. Based on user inputs and historical clickstream data, we dynamically redirect users to a customized page tailored to their preferences, **\_all in real-time \_**_for that session._

### Why use Quizzing?

- Collect first-party data from users.
- Guide them to the right product/page.
- Improve engagement and conversions.

### How Quiz Results Are Utilised?

- As users interact with the quiz, their responses are stored **for that session**.
- We combine this quiz data with their **past clickstream behavior**.
- Based on this combined input, we **redirect users to a personalized page** (e.g., product listings, category pages, etc.).

This helps users quickly discover relevant products, driving engagement and higher conversions.
