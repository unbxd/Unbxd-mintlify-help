Slotting a product allows you to assign a specific product to predefined positions in the search results. Unlike Pin, Slot ensures a product occupies the assigned position only if it meets the defined conditions. If the conditions are not met, the slot remains unfilled, and other rules or algorithms determine the products to be filled in those positions.

Also, Slot can cover multiple positions simultaneously, allowing you to assign several products across various spots in one go. Pin, on the other hand, is restricted to assigning a single product to a single position at a time.

## Setting up Slot

1. Click the Slot button in the Set merchandising strategy section.
2. Choose Range: Mention for which position to which position you want to add conditions.
3. Select Attribute: Choose the [Attribute](/user-guides/merchandising/introduction#attributes) you want to base the condition on from the drop-down menu.
4. Choose Operator: Define the [Operator](/user-guides/merchandising/introduction#values) by clicking the *=\`* button and selecting the desired one (e.g., equals, contains).
5. Set Value: Select the attribute [Value](/user-guides/merchandising/introduction#operators) that the condition will match or exclude.

## Adding multiple conditions within a Slot Group

1. Once you've added the first condition to a Slot group, you can include more conditions by clicking + Add Another Attribute.
2. All conditions within the group must be satisfied for a product to occupy the designated Slot positions. Products not meeting all conditions will not be slotted into the specified positions.

<Note>Products cannot be pinned and slotted simultaneously at the same position.</Note>

## Adding new Slot groups

1. Click + Add New Slot Group to define conditions for an additional range of product positions.
2. For each Slot group, you can create specific conditions to filter the products eligible to occupy those positions.

<Note>Groups are connected with an OR condition. This means if the products meet all the conditions of at least one group, they will be included.</Note>

## Deleting existing Slot conditions

If you accessed this page from the listing page, click the Edit icon next to Slot in the Strategy Summary section.

1. To delete an entire Slot group, click the Delete icon next to the desired group and confirm your action.
2. To remove a specific Slot condition within a group, click the Delete icon next to the condition and confirm your action.

## Final steps:
