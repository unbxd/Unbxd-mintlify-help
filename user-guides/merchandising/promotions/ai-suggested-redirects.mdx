## Overview

**AI Suggested Redirects** enable users to create redirects for seasonal collections or category paths that are broadly applicable. These recommendations are powered by **Netcore Unbxd’s AI**, leveraging **past search patterns**, **user behavior**, **popular searches**, and **trending queries.**

This feature allows merchandisers to automatically configure redirects suggested by Unbxd, ensuring that users are directed to the most relevant and timely content based on emerging trends and search data. This enhances the browsing experience and ensures that users can easily find the products they are most likely to search for, optimizing site navigation and search performance.

## Set Up AI Suggested Redirects

Navigate to **Merchandising** \> **Search** \> **Redirects**. Click on **AI Suggested Redirects**.

<Info>
  When the user clicks for the first time on **AI Suggested Redirects**, the system will kick off a job to generate suggestions based on past search patterns and trends. These suggestions will be ready within the next hour.
</Info>

Once the suggestions are up, there will be two options for users to select:

| **Option** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accept** | Click **Accept**, if you liked a suggested redirect. You can **Preview** it in a new tab before applying it. This allows you to review the redirect before finalizing it. |
| **Reject** | Click**Reject**, if you did not like the suggested redirect. The system will ensure that the specific suggestion will **never** be shown again in the future.             |

<Info>
  - AI-generated redirect suggestions will be refreshed every 15 days.
  - After the 15-day refresh interval, when you click on the button again, the system will trigger a new job to update the suggestions. This process may take time to complete.

  To view a comprehensive list of all your redirect campaigns, select the site key, click Merchandising, navigate to Search, and then Banners.

  Key information on the campaign list

  - Campaigns are grouped by query. If multiple campaigns are set for the same query, they will appear in the same row of that query.
  - Details available on each listing
    - The campaign’s date range
    - The segment it’s applied to
    - Its current status (Active, Upcoming, Draft, Stopped, or Expired)

  Finding the campaign/query using Filters and the search bar

  1. Log in to Netcore Unbxd’s self-serve console ↗
  2. In the Site Key Picker, select the site where you want to apply the merchandising strategy.
  3. Once the site is selected, go to the Merchandising section.

     1. Status – Active, Upcoming, Draft
     2. Created On – Date range
     3. Created By – The user who created the campaign
     4. Segment – Associated Segment
  8. After selecting your desired options, click Apply Filters.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to edit an existing campaign or publish a draft campaign?">
  If you have added a Redirect and saved it as a draft or want to make changes to a live redirect campaign, you can follow the steps below to publish it on the live site.

  1. Locate the campaign you wish to modify.
  2. Click the Edit icon to open the campaign.
  3. Review the campaign details and make necessary edits to the rules by clicking the Edit icon next to the respective rule or condition.
  4. After verifying all the changes, click Publish rule to make the campaign live.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to view a summary of my redirect campaign?">
  To view the summary of any specific campaign, locate the campaign in the list and click the Eye icon at the far-right end of the row.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to apply the same rule to additional queries?">
  Sometimes, you may want to apply the same redirect to multiple queries. For instance, if you’ve set up a redirect for the search query “help,” it might be beneficial to include other queries like “support” or “talk to an expert” under the same campaign.

  To do this:

  1. Locate the campaign you wish to modify.
  2. Click the More options icon next to the existing query.
  3. Select \+ Apply same rule to more queries from the dropdown.
  4. In the popup window, enter the additional queries in the Add Queries section. Separate multiple queries with a comma.
  5. Press Enter to confirm.
  6. Review the added queries and click Apply Changes.

  Now, all the redirects defined for the query in the original campaign will also apply to the newly added queries.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why to create new redirects for the same query?">
  1. Segment-specific targeting: Tailor redirects to different audience segments (e.g., different support pages for different regions) for the same query to deliver personalized experiences.
  2. Time-bound promotions: Create redirects for short-term events (like flash sales) while maintaining an evergreen redirect for the same query.
  3. Diverse objectives: Address different goals, such as promoting new brands while pushing best-selling brands for the same search term.
  4. Flexibility in prioritization: Set up redirects with different priority levels to ensure the most critical rules take precedence based on the timing or business need.

  Options to achieve this in the Netcore Unbxd console:

  1. Duplicate an existing campaign
  2. Create a new campaign for the same query

  Key Difference:
  When duplicating a campaign, all existing information is carried over, saving you time. However, when creating a new campaign for the same query, only the query is pre-selected, and you must configure other details from scratch.

<Accordion title="How to duplicate existing campaigns?">
  1. Locate the campaign you wish to modify.
  2. Click the More Options icon at the far-right end of the row.
  3. Select Duplicate Rule.

  5. Apart from the query, you can edit and change every other section.
  6. It is mandatory not to have overlapping date ranges for two campaigns with the same query if the target segments are the same. It is advised to change the same to avoid errors in saving or publishing. Learn how to set up the redirect.
  7. Once satisfied, you can
     1. Click the Save button to retain the Campaign as a draft.
     2. Click the Publish rule button to push it live.
