sidebarTitle: "Overview"

To customize product placement in Search Results Pages (SRPs), retailers can leverage the Promotions section under merchandising in the Netcore Unbxd Self Serve Console. This feature allows businesses to strategically control and prioritize the visibility of products based on their marketing goals.

<Accordion title="What can I do with Netcore Unbxd Promotions?">
  ### 1. Boost products

  Giving a boost to certain products lets you place high-priority items at the top of search results for specific queries.

  For example:

  - An outdoor gear store could display "insulated water bottles" as a top result when users search for "camping essentials."
  - When new arrivals like “designer handbags” are introduced, merchandising rules can prioritize them in search results to give them visibility, even if they haven't yet accumulated sales data.

  #### 2. Bury products

  You can exclude certain products from search results to maintain relevance if they are irrelevant to specific queries. For instance, in a beauty store’s search for “vegan,” products containing animal-based ingredients can be hidden.

  #### 3. Pin products

  Pinning allows you to fix selected products in specific positions within search results, ensuring that high-priority items are always visible to shoppers.

  For example:

  - A fashion retailer can pin their latest seasonal collection, like “winter coats,” to the top of search results when customers search for “outerwear,” ensuring that trending items are highlighted.
  - For a grocery store’s search for “organic snacks,” pinning popular, high-margin products ensures these items are always seen first, regardless of other search results.

  #### 4. Slot products

  Slotting enables you to assign particular products to a fixed rank within search results, allowing for strategic placement based on shopper intent and merchandising goals.

  For example:

  - An electronics store could slot popular items, like “noise-canceling headphones,” in the first few positions for searches related to “headphones,” ensuring they stay prominent among options.
  - A furniture store can position specific items, like “ergonomic office chairs,” in visible positions for “home office furniture” searches, maintaining high visibility for top-performing products.

  #### 5. Sort listing page

  Sorting enables you to organize search results based on a chosen attribute. You can display products in ascending or descending order for numerical attributes, while text-based attributes allow for alphabetical sorting from A-Z or Z-A. By default, products appear in order of relevance to best match your shoppers' search intent.

  For example:

  - For categories like electronics or furniture, sort items by price to show products from lowest to highest, helping price-sensitive shoppers make quick comparisons.
  - For lists with brand names or product types, an alphabetical A-Z or Z-A order will allow shoppers to navigate quickly, especially if they’re looking for specific brands or product lines.

  #### 6. A/B Testing

  Experiment with different merchandising tactics by showing alternative versions of search results to different shopper segments. Analyze which configurations drive the highest engagement and conversions.

  For example:

  - Test different placements for new arrivals versus best-sellers to see which increases engagement.
  - Compare conversion rates between displays that prioritize high-margin items vs. popular products.

  #### 7. Landing Pages

  Create custom landing pages tailored to specific search queries, seasonal themes, or promotions. Dedicated landing pages enhance the shopping experience by gathering relevant products in one spot.

  For example:

  - For “Back to School,” create a landing page showing backpacks, stationery, and lunch bags.
  - For “Mother’s Day Gifts,” curate a landing page with gift recommendations across multiple categories.

## Types of rules you can configure in the Promotions section

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Global Rule">
    It is applied universally across all queries and segments, ensuring consistent promotional strategy throughout the site.

    - Only one Global Rule can exist per site.
    - The Global Rule impacts all site search queries.
    - It is automatically created when a site is set up.
    - Only [Boost/Bury](/user-guides/merchandising/promotions/boost) or [Filter](/user-guides/merchandising/promotions/filter) merchandising strategies can be applied through the Global Rule.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Query-specific Rules">
    Query-specific merchandising rules allow you to customize promotions for specific queries or segments, offering a more targeted approach to shopper engagement. With Query-specific rules, you can design your merchandising strategies using one or a combination of these options:

    - [Boost/Bury](/user-guides/merchandising/promotions/boost): Increase or decrease product visibility.
    - [Sort](/user-guides/merchandising/promotions/sort): Arrange products based on specific criteria.
    - [Pin](/user-guides/merchandising/promotions/pin): Fix key products at any exact position from 1 to 50.
    - [Slot](/user-guides/merchandising/promotions/slot): Assign multiple products to predefined positions in a single go.
    - [Filter](/user-guides/merchandising/promotions/filter): Exclude or include products from a superset.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  In terms of product display order, query-specific rules take priority over the global rule.
</Note>

For example, suppose you have a Global Rule that boosts the visibility of "Summer Dresses" across all search queries. However, for the query "Winter Sale," you apply a Query-Specific Rule to bury "Summer Dresses" because they are irrelevant for winter promotions. In this case, the Query-Specific Rule for "Winter Sale" will take precedence, and "Summer Dresses" will be hidden in the search results for that query, even though the Global Rule boosts them.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to edit an existing campaign or publish a draft campaign?">
    If you have created a Promotions campaign and saved it as a draft or want to make changes to a live campaign, you can follow the steps below to publish it on the live site.

    1. Locate the campaign you wish to modify.
    2. Click the Edit icon to open the campaign.
    3. Review the campaign details and make necessary edits to the rules by clicking the Edit icon next to the respective rule or condition.
    4. After verifying all the changes, click Publish rule to make the campaign live.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to view a summary of the rules I added to my campaign?">
    To view the summary of a specific campaign, locate the campaign in the list and click the Eye icon at the far-right end of the row.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to apply the same rule to additional queries?">
    Sometimes, you may want to apply the same rules to additional queries without duplicating the entire campaign. For instance, if you’ve set up a campaign to hide out-of-stock products, it might be beneficial to include other high-performing queries under the same campaign.

    To do this:

    1. Locate the campaign you wish to modify.
    2. Click the More options icon next to the existing query.
    3. Select \+ Apply same rule to more queries from the dropdown.
    4. In the popup window, enter the additional queries in the Add Queries section. Separate multiple queries with a comma.
    5. Press Enter to confirm.
    6. Review the added queries and click Apply Changes.

    Now, all the rules defined for the original query in the campaign will also apply to the newly added queries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why to create new campaigns for the same query?">
    It allows you to manage and prioritize multiple promotions or strategies for a single search term. Here’s why you might want to do this:

    1. Segment-specific targeting: Tailor campaigns to different audience segments (e.g., new vs. returning customers) for the same query to deliver personalized experiences.
    2. Time-bound promotions: Create separate campaigns for short-term events (like flash sales) while maintaining an evergreen campaign for the same query.
    3. Diverse objectives: Address different goals, such as promoting new arrivals while also pushing best-sellers for the same search term.
    4. Flexibility in prioritization: Set up campaigns with different priority levels to ensure the most critical rules take precedence based on the timing or business need.

    Options to achieve this in the Netcore Unbxd console:

    1. Duplicate an existing campaign
    2. Create a new campaign for the same query

    Key Difference:
    When duplicating a campaign, all existing rules and conditions are carried over, saving you time. However, when creating a new campaign for the same query, only the query is pre-selected, and you must configure all rules and conditions from scratch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to duplicate existing campaigns?">
    1. Locate the campaign you wish to modify.
    2. Click the More Options icon at the far-right end of the row.
    3. Select Duplicate Rule.
    4. A copy of the respective campaign will be created and opened.
    5. Apart from the query, you can edit and change every other section.
    6. It is mandatory not to have overlapping date ranges for two campaigns with the same query if the target segments are the same. It is advised to change the same to avoid errors in saving or publishing. Learn how to setup the merchandising strategy.
    7. Once satisfied, you can
       1. Click the Save button to retain the Campaign as a draft.
       2. Click the Publish rule button to push it live.
