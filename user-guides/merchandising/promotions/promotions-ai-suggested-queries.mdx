## AI-Suggested Queries

AI-Suggested Queries recommend relevant search terms and category-based recommendations based on past search patterns, user behavior, popular searches, and semantic understanding.

This helps users refine their queries, discover products efficiently, and reduce zero-result searches.

\> **Example**:

\> If you enter `black` as a query, the algorithm will surface related terms like:

\> - black dress

\> - black shoes

\> - black bag

\> - black sneakers

Click the \*`+`\*\* icon next to each query you want to include, then click **Apply Changes**.

The same rules will now apply to all the selected queries.
