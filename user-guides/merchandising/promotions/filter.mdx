Filtering products allows you to include or exclude specific products from the search results based on defined conditions. Unlike other merchandising strategies like Boost, Sort, Slot, or Pin, Filter strictly removes products that donâ€™t meet the specified criteria.

## Setting up Filter:

1. Click the Filter button in the Set merchandising strategy section.
2. Select Attribute: Choose the [Attribute](/user-guides/merchandising/introduction#attributes) you want to base the condition on from the drop-down menu. (If an attribute is missing from the dropdown, you need to navigate to the Field Configuration page and add it to the configuration table.)

3. Choose Operator: Define the [Operator](/user-guides/merchandising/introduction#values) by clicking the _=\`_ button and selecting the desired one (e.g., equals, contains).
4. Set Value: Select the attribute [Value](/user-guides/merchandising/introduction#operators) that the condition will match or exclude.

## Adding multiple conditions within a Filter Group:

1. Once you've added the first condition to a Filter group, you can include more conditions by clicking \+ Add Another Attribute.
2. All conditions within the group must be satisfied for a product to be filtered. Products not meeting all conditions will not be visible.

## Adding new Filter groups

1. Use _\+ Add new Filter group_ to create additional Filter groups.
2. Additional products that meet the conditions of the secondary groups will also be shortlisted.

<Note>
  Groups are connected with an OR condition. This means if the products meet all the conditions of at least one group, they will be included.
</Note>

## Deleting existing Filter conditions

If you accessed this page from the listing page, click the Edit icon next to Filter in the Strategy Summary section.

1. To delete an entire Filter group, click the Delete icon next to the desired group and confirm your action.
2. To remove a specific Filter condition within a group, click the Delete icon next to the condition and confirm your action.

## Final steps

1. Once you have configured the rule, click Apply filter.
2. You can also view your merchandising strategy summary by clicking the View summary button.

<Note>
  Viewing the summary before applying the changes will lead to the configurations being lost. It is _recommended_ that you click Apply filter before viewing the summary.
