Sorting allows you to organize search results based on a chosen attribute:

* Numerical Attributes: Arrange results in ascending (lowest to highest) or descending (highest to lowest) order.
* Text Attributes: Sort alphabetically, either from A-Z or Z-A.

By default, products are displayed based on their relevance to the shopper's search intent. Sorting allows you to override this default.

<Note>Using Sort disables Boost, Pin, and Slot.</Note>

## Setting up Sort

1. Click the Sort button in the Set merchandising strategy section.
2. Select the Attribute you want to sort by from the drop-down.
3. Choose the Order for sorting.

## Add Additional Conditions

To include more sorting criteria, click + Add a set of conditions and repeat the process. Each new condition will be applied sequentially using the "THEN" operator.

Example:

* First Rule: Sort by *Material\_Type* in Ascending Order (A to Z):
  Products made of "Cotton" will appear before those made of "Leather," followed by "Velvet," alphabetically.
* Second Rule: Sort by *Price* in Descending Order (High to Low):
  Among products with the same *Material\_Type*, the most expensive items will be listed first, followed by less expensive ones.

## Deleting existing Sort conditions

1. To remove a specific sort condition, click the Delete icon next to it.
2. Confirm your action by clicking Delete.
