Redirects allow you to route users to a particular page of your preference. This is useful when you want your shoppers to view products relevant to their queries from your catalog. For instance, if you create a landing page for products related to Thanksgiving, redirect your shoppers to this page whenever they search for products related to Thanksgiving.

  <Accordion title="How to edit an existing campaign or publish a draft campaign?">
    If you have added a Redirect and saved it as a draft or want to make changes to a live redirect campaign, you can follow the steps below to publish it on the live site.

    1. Locate the campaign you wish to modify.
    2. Click the Edit icon to open the campaign.
    3. Review the campaign details and make necessary edits to the rules by clicking the Edit icon next to the respective rule or condition.
    4. After verifying all the changes, click Publish rule to make the campaign live.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to view a summary of my redirect campaign?">
    To view the summary of any specific campaign, locate the campaign in the list and click the Eye icon at the far-right end of the row.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to apply the same rule to additional queries?">
    Sometimes, you may want to apply the same redirect to multiple queries. For instance, if you’ve set up a redirect for the search query “help,” it might be beneficial to include other queries like “support” or “talk to an expert” under the same campaign.

    To do this:

    1. Locate the campaign you wish to modify.
    2. Click the More options icon next to the existing query.
    3. Select \+ Apply same rule to more queries from the dropdown.
    4. In the popup window, enter the additional queries in the Add Queries section. Separate multiple queries with a comma.
    5. Press Enter to confirm.
    6. Review the added queries and click Apply Changes.

    Now, all the redirects defined for the query in the original campaign will also apply to the newly added queries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why to create new redirects for the same query?">
    1. Segment-specific targeting: Tailor redirects to different audience segments (e.g., different support pages for different regions) for the same query to deliver personalized experiences.
    2. Time-bound promotions: Create redirects for short-term events (like flash sales) while maintaining an evergreen redirect for the same query.
    3. Diverse objectives: Address different goals, such as promoting new brands while pushing best-selling brands for the same search term.
    4. Flexibility in prioritization: Set up redirects with different priority levels to ensure the most critical rules take precedence based on the timing or business need.

    Options to achieve this in the Netcore Unbxd console:

    1. Duplicate an existing campaign
    2. Create a new campaign for the same query

    Key Difference:
    When duplicating a campaign, all existing information is carried over, saving you time. However, when creating a new campaign for the same query, only the query is pre-selected, and you must configure other details from scratch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to duplicate existing campaigns?">
    1. Locate the campaign you wish to modify.
    2. Click the More Options icon at the far-right end of the row.
    3. Select Duplicate Rule.
    4. A copy of the respective campaign will be created and opened.
    5. Apart from the query, you can edit and change every other section.
    6. It is mandatory not to have overlapping date ranges for two campaigns with the same query if the target segments are the same. It is advised to change the same to avoid errors in saving or publishing. Learn how to set up the redirect.
    7. Once satisfied, you can
       1. Click the Save button to retain the Campaign as a draft.
       2. Click the Publish rule button to push it live.
