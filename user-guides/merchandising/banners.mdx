The Banners section allows you to effectively promote products, brands, special offers, or seasonal sales directly on your platform. With a single click, shoppers can be redirected to the desired landing page, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Types of Banners

### Query-based Banner

These banners are directly tied to search queries. They appear on the search results page when the merchandised query matches the shopper query. They are ideal for promoting brands, offers, or events explicitly related to what the shopper is searching for.

Know how to create a query-based banner‚Üó

How It Works:

1. You define a specific query in the Merchandising Workbench.
2. When a shopper enters that query, the corresponding banner is displayed at the top of the search results page.

Example:

* For the query ‚ÄúWoolen jacket‚Äù, a banner saying ‚ÄúFlat 20% Off on Winter Wear ‚Äì Limited Time Offer!‚Äù with relevant visuals can be displayed.
* For the query ‚ÄúGaming Laptops‚Äù, the visual for a banner saying ‚ÄúBuy a Gaming Laptop Today and Get Free Accessories!‚Äù can be shown.

### Field-based Banner

Field-based banners are contextually triggered based on the products retrieved in the search results. They are displayed when more than 80% of the retrieved products match specific criteria such as category, product type, or brand defined by you.

Know how to create a field-based banner‚Üó

Use Case:
Field-based banners are perfect for dynamically adapting promotions to the dominant category or product type in the search results, ensuring highly relevant messaging.

How It Works:

1. Define field rule criteria (e.g., Product Type: Running Shoes or Category: Electronics).
2. If 80% or more of the search results satisfy the field rule, the corresponding banner is displayed.

Example:

* If a shopper searches for ‚ÄúRunning Shoes‚Äù, and 80% of the results belong to ‚ÄúNike‚Äù of the Brand Attribute, a banner saying ‚ÄúShop Nike Shoes at 10% Off‚Äù can appear.
* If the shopper searches for ‚ÄúCost-friendly smartphones‚Äù, and the majority of results are within the price range of ‚Äú$ 500‚Äù, a banner saying ‚ÄúExclusive Offers on cost-friendly mobiles!‚Äù can be displayed.

<Note>
When to choose Query-based and Field-based Banners?
* Use Query-based Banners when you want to control banners for specific, predefined searches.
* Use Field-based Banners for dynamic, context-driven banners that respond to the product mix in the search results.
</Note>

## Assets required

You can configure your banner in two ways:
1. Use a pre-designed image
2. Write HTML Code

### Use a pre-designed image
If you already have a designed banner image:
* Enter the Banner Image URL: Provide the link to your banner image hosted on a platform of your choice.
* Set the Destination URL: Add the link where shoppers will be redirected upon clicking the banner.
<Note>Ensure the banner image URL is publicly accessible to avoid display issues.</Note>

### Add HTML code
If you prefer to design your banner using HTML instead of an image, you can directly enter the HTML code along with all the necessary details.

Here's an example HTML code for a banner with the text "Exclusive Offers on cost-friendly mobiles!":
```html
<div style="width: 100%; background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
  <a href="https://example.com/cost-friendly-mobiles" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">
    <img src="https://example.com/banner-image.jpg" alt="Exclusive Offers on cost-friendly mobiles!" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h2 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #333; margin-top: 10px;">Exclusive Offers on Cost-Friendly Mobiles!</h2>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #555; font-size: 16px;">Click here to shop now and save big!</p>
  </a>
</div>
```
<Info>
Code explanation:
    1. **div** block: Contains the banner with styles for width, padding, and background color.
    2. Anchor tag (**\<a>**): Makes the entire banner clickable, linking to the product or offer page.
    3. Image (**\<img>**): Displays the banner image with a responsive design.
    4. Heading (**\<h2>**): Highlights the banner's main message.
    5. Paragraph (**\<p>**): Provides an additional call to action or descriptive text.
