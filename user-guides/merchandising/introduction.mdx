## What are the Netcore Unbxd UI terminologies you should know?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Attributes">
    In an ecommerce catalog, attributes are the characteristics or properties that describe a product. These attributes can be textual or numerical and help effectively organize, filter, and display products.

    **Example:** Attributes like Color, Price, and Brand define key traits of a product.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Values">
    Values represent the specific details or data points associated with an attribute. These values define the characteristics that an attribute describes.

    - **Example:**
      - The attribute Color might have values like _Red_, _Blue_, or _Green_.
      - The attribute Price might have values like _50_, _100_, or _150_.
      - The attribute Brand might have values like _Nike_ or _Adidas_.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Operators">
    Conditions allow you to create rules by comparing attributes and their values. These conditions determine how products are filtered, boosted, or buried. This is applicable for Boost & Filter
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Equals (=)">
    The attribute value must exactly match the specified value.
    **Example:**
    Brand = Nike will include only products with the brand "Nike." Products like "Nike Limited Edition" will not be included because it's not an exact match.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not Equals (≠)">
    The attribute value must not exactly match the specified value.
    **Example:**
    Color ≠ Red will exclude products that have "Red" as their color. However, products like "Dark Red" or "Red Velvet" will still be included because they are not an exact match for "Red."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contains (⊂)">
    The attribute value must include the specified keyword or text.
    **Example:**
    Brand ⊂ "Nike" will include products where the brand contains the word "Nike," such as "Nike" or "Nike Limited Edition."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Not Contain (⊄)">
    The attribute value must not contain the specified keyword or text.
    **Example:**
    Color ⊄ "Red" will exclude all products with "Red" anywhere in the color description, such as "Dark Red" or "Red Velvet."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Greater than or Equal to (>=)">
    The attribute value must be greater than or equal to the specified value.

    **Example**: "Price \>= 100".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Less than or Equal to (<=)">
    The attribute value must be less than or equal to the specified value. Example: "Rating \<= 4".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Logical Operators">
    ### AND:

    All conditions must be true for the rule to apply. This operator is used to combine multiple conditions where all must be met.
    **Example:**
    Brand = Nike AND Color = Red will include only products that are both "Nike" and "Red."

    ### OR:

    At least one of the conditions must be true for the rule to apply. This operator is used to broaden the scope of the condition.
    **Example:**
    Brand = Nike OR Brand = Adidas will include products from either "Nike" or "Adidas," but not necessarily both.

    ### THEN:

    This operator is used to define the sequence of rules. If the first condition is met, the second rule will apply. It is typically used when you want to create a layered, sequential set of rules.
    **Example:**
    Sort by Price Ascending THEN Sort by Rating Descending means that the products will first be sorted by price from low to high. If products are at the same price, they will be sorted by rating them high or low.

## How to combine rules to create a cohesive merchandising strategy?

Netcore Unbxd Workbench supports using multiple merchandising rules, enabling retailers to create a cohesive shopping experience.

Here’s a simple example for a search query "back-to-school" campaign:

1. Segment shoppers.
2. Run a banner to advertise the campaign on the home page, category pages, and search query listing pages.
3. Create a landing page by applying filters for stationery, lunch bags, or water bottles.
4. Redirect users to the landing page dedicated to back-to-school products and deals.
5. Boost new arrivals and highly rated items unique to each segment and bury products with lower ratings.
6. Pin items from popular brands in positions 1 to 10 on the search result page.
7. Analyze the campaign's performance and the shoppers’ journeys to apply what was learned in the next campaign.
