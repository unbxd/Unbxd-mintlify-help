**Vector Search** is a smart AI-enabled feature in Unbxd that helps shoppers find the right products  easily. Instead of just looking for exact words in a search (like traditional search engines do), **Vector Search** understands what the shopper **_means_**.

So even if the search doesn’t use the exact same words as the product listings, it can still show the most relevant results. Vector Search doesn’t just look at the words you typed. It tries to **understand what you really mean** — your _intent_. So instead of just matching words, it matches **meaning**.

For example, if you have a search query like “**shoes for hiking in the mountains**”, Vector Search can **also show**:

- “trail running shoes”
- “outdoor hiking boots”
- “mountain trekking footwear”
- “all-terrain sneakers”

These are all **semantically related**, even if they don’t contain the exact same words.\
This is especially helpful for longer, more detailed searches, like when someone types a full sentence or a specific need.

## Prerequisites

1. You should have a valid **UNBXD account** with appropriate permissions to access the **Self-Serve Console**.
2. **Vector Search** must be enabled on your UNBXD panel. Refer [here](https://docs.netcoreunbxd.com/user-guides/merchandising/Algorithms/Intent/VectorSearch#enable-vector-search) to enable Vector Search in your account.

### Enable Vector Search

1. Navigate to **Unbxd console** \> **Algorithm **\> **Intent** \> **Vector Search.**
2. Click on the **"Contact support**" link, which will auto create a ticket for enabling this feature at the product end for approval. Once approved, the toggle button will be in an active state for the customer.

   Once the feature is enabled, the Customer is set to use the Vector search for the search-related queries. You need to set up the strategy at your end for **Hybrid search** and **FallBack search** as below:

   Since Vector Search works best with long-tailed queries, you need to manually set up the minimum number of words to activate Vector Search.

   <Info>
     **Hybrid Search** combines both traditional keyword-based search and vector search. 

     It ensures that users benefit from the precision of keyword matching while also leveraging the semantic understanding provided by Vector Search.\
     \
     **Fallback Search** ensures if a regular keyword search shows **very few or no products**, Unbxd will automatically use **Vector Search** instead.

     Vector Search looks at the **meaning** of the search, not just the exact words. This helps show products that are **related or relevant**, even if they don’t include the same keywords.

#### Use Case

|                                           | **Traditional flow**                                                                                                                                         | \*\*Traditional search \+ Vector Search \*\*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Hybrid Strategy using Vector Search**   | If a user types "**smartphone**" in the search bar. Traditionally, the search result will give, for example, 15 products, matching the exact search keywords | If vector search is enabled, the search can also surface products that are categorised as "smartphones" but also use description terms as “**mobile phone"**, **"cell phone"**, **"smart device"**, and **"gadget"**. This helps ensure that search results are semantically relevant, even if the keywords don't match exactly, and the search result could be 40.                                                                                      |
| **Fallback strategy using Vector Search** | If a user types a search query as "**running shoes**", and the search result gives 10 product listings for running shoes                                     | Initially, the user has set the minimum number of products for which the fallback model will be activate vector search is 10, then automatically vector search will get activated and include your search result with product description  **“sports shoes”**, **“jogging shoes”**, **“athletic shoes”**, **“trail running shoes”**. Even though these terms do not exactly match the search query. an extra 20 products for the keyword "running shoes" |

Let’s say a user types “**leather shoes**” in the search bar. With vector search, even if the product listings don’t explicitly contain the exact phrase “leather shoes”, the search can still surface products that are semantically related. For example, products listed as “genuine leather boots” or “premium leather sandals” could still appear in the search results for “leather shoes”.

Similarly, items labeled as “cowhide shoes”, “full-grain leather loafers”, or “vegan leather sneakers” might also surface  (if vector search understands the semantic context of "leather") , even though those keywords don’t exactly match the search term "leather shoes."

### Impact of Vector Search 

Vector Search helps users find what they _mean_, not just what they _say_. It improves the accuracy, depth, and usefulness of search results, especially for longer or more natural language queries.

- **Understands intent:**\
  Helps the search engine interpret the _meaning_ behind what users type, not just the words.
- **Fewer dead ends:**\
  Reduces the chances of “no results found” pages by showing related products.
- **Better relevance:**\
  Surfaces products that truly match what the user is looking for, even if the keywords don’t match exactly.
- **Boosts conversions:**\
  When users find what they need faster, they’re more likely to buy — improving sales and user satisfaction.
