## Overview

This feature lets you run more accurate searches using specific product details like **size**, **weight**, **price**, or **pressure**. You can fine-tune search results by setting up a strategy and using product attributes that have measurable values and units.\
\
_For example,_ if you have a search query: "28 inch denim jeans".  Here, "**28 inches**" refers to a **measurable dimension**.\
\
**Search Context:** The system understands that the user is looking for jeans that have a waist measurement of **28 inches**. This is a clear, quantifiable search attribute (the waist size) that the system can use to filter and narrow down the results.\
**Measurable Dimension:** A specific, quantifiable attribute of a product (such as size, weight, or price) that can be used to filter or refine search results based on exact values or units.

## Impact of Vector Search

- **Refined Search Results:**\
  By setting exact dimensions like **width**, **weight**, and **price**, you can **narrow down** the search to products that meet all your specific needs.
- **Saves Time:**\
  Instead of browsing through irrelevant products, this method allows users to find exactly what they need faster by applying filters based on exact measurements.
- **Personalized Results:**\
  Users can specify **exact sizes, weights, and prices**, making the search process **more personalized** and tailored to their preferences.
- **Better Shopping Experience:**\
  By focusing on specific product attributes, customers can quickly find items that **match their exact requirements**, leading to a **smoother and more satisfying** shopping experience.

## Prerequisites

1. You should have a valid **UNBXD account** with appropriate permissions to access the **Self-Serve Console**. The console allows you to configure various aspects of your search, product data, and system settings.
2. **Measurement Search** must be enabled on your UNBXD account. This could be enabled by clicking on the toggle button.

## Set up Measurement Search

1. Navigate to Unbxd console \> **Algorithm** \> **Intent** \> **Measurement Search**
2. Click on the **CTA button** to enable the Measurement Search.

3. **Strategy Selection**: You can select either of the available strategy: Boost or Filter.
   - **Boost Strategy : **This strategy **gives priority** to products that are **close to** the measurement the user searched for — even if they're not an exact match. \
     For example**: **If a user searches for a "7 kg washing machine", and only 7.5 kg models are available, then the system will still show the **7.5 kg** options at the **top** of the results.

   It works best when shoppers are **open to similar options** or when exact matches are not available.
   - **Filter Strategy: **This strategy only shows products that **exactly match** the measurement in the search.\
     For example**: **If a user searches for a "7 kg washing machine", the system will show **only** washing machines that are **exactly 7 kg**. No 6.5 kg or 7.5 kg options will be included.

   It works best when shoppers are looking for a **specific size or fit**, with no flexibility.
4. **Configure Attributes**: This section enables search using measurable attributes. You must select the attributes from the catalog and map the dimensions and units accordingly. You can add up to 5 attributes per dimension type. Currently we support the following units:

   | Dimension    | Unit                                                                                                             |
   | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Price        | usd, aud, cad, sgd, gbp, cent, $, €, £, ₹                                                                        |
   | Size         | mm, cm, m, mi, in, ft, mm2, cm2, m2, mi2, in2, ft2, mm3, cm3, m3, mi3, in3, ft3, l, fl oz, gal, qt, pt, bbl, tsp |
   | Weight       | mg, g, kg, lb, oz                                                                                                |
   | Pressure     | pa, kpa, atm, torr, bar, psi, mmhg, psia, psig, ksi                                                              |
   | Product Info | b, kb, mb, gb, tb, pb, eb, ib, kib, mib, gib, tib, pib, eib                                                      |
5. **Default Configuration**: This is used to power the queries that do not have a dimension attribute.\
   For example, your search query is "**red shirt under 10**". \
   Here, the user/merchandiser must set up a default dimension (Price or Size, in this case) so that the search result displays products with a price less than $10 or products with a size less than ten.
6. **Tolerance configuration**: It is a flexibility factor that gives you better search results.\
   Currently, the query builder follows a configurable normalization range of ±10%.

After the type of strategy is decided, click **Save** configuration and click **Sync** add measurement search configurations to your search.

### Use Case

A user searches for a **coffee table**, the user enters search query: **"Coffee table 48x24x18"** (48 inches long, 24 inches wide, 18 inches high).

The search engine would parse these dimensions and query for products where:

- **Length = 48 inches**
- **Width = 24 inches**
- **Height = 18 inches**

Measurement-based search in **UNBXD** helps users find products that meet specific criteria based on measurable dimensions (size, weight, pressure, etc.). It improves the overall shopping experience by allowing precise searches and delivering highly relevant results based on the user's needs.
