# **What are Phrases?**

Phrases are common multi-word search terms that shoppers use when looking for specific types of products (e.g., "paintbrush," "shoe polish," "running shoes"). The Phrases feature allows you to define these multi-word terms and guide the search engine to understand the shopper's _true intent_ behind them, leading to more relevant search results.

## **Why are Phrases Important?**

Without specific guidance, a search engine might treat each word in a multi-word query equally. For example:

A search for **"paint brush"** could return a mix of _any_ product related to 'paint' (like cans of paint) and _any_ product related to 'brush' (like hair brushes), alongside actual paint brushes. This happens if the engine isn't well-trained or lacks sufficient data to understand the combined meaning.

This can lead to a confusing and inaccurate search experience. The Phrases feature solves this by letting you specify which part of the phrase is most crucial for determining relevance.

### **How Phrases Work: Controlling Relevance**

When you add a phrase, you instruct the search system on how to prioritize results based on the shopper's multi-word query. You have three options to define this relevance:

| Option                      | Description                                                                                                                     |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Include the left-term**   | Displays results matching the **full phrase** AND results strongly related to the **leftmost significant word** of the phrase.  |
| **Include the right-term**  | Displays results matching the **full phrase** AND results strongly related to the **rightmost significant word** of the phrase. |
| **Include the full phrase** | Displays _only_ results that closely match the **exact full phrase** entered.                                                   |

> For phrases with three or more words (e.g., "Hand sanitizer dispenser"), the "left-term" and "right-term" options refer to the most significant defining word on the respective side ('Hand' or 'Dispenser' in the example), guiding the focus along with the full phrase match.

## **What Phrases Should NOT Include**

To ensure phrases function correctly and maintain data quality, avoid entries that are:

- **Empty or Blank:** Phrases cannot be empty or consist only of whitespace.
- **Symbol-Only:** Phrases composed _entirely_ of symbols are not permitted.
- **Containing Forbidden Characters:** Avoid using the following characters within any part of the phrase: `,` (comma), `+` (plus), `{` (curly braces), `}` (curly braces), `*` (asterisk), `&` (ampersand), `\` (backslash).
- **Purely Alphanumeric/Codes:** Phrases must contain meaningful words. Entries consisting _only_ of numbers or alphanumeric codes without descriptive text (e.g., "12345", "ABC789") are not valid phrases.
- **Stopword-Only:** Phrases made _entirely_ of common, non-specific words (e.g., "the of", "for a") lack meaning and are invalid.
- **Single Words:** This feature is for _multi-word_ terms. Do not add single words (e.g., "shoes"). A phrase must contain at least two words to be effective here.
