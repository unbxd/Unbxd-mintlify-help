**Spellcheck Override** is a rule-based control that allows merchandisers to **override automatic spell correction** for specific search queries or terms. This ensures that intentionally unique or brand-specific terms are not auto-corrected, preserving the intended search behavior and improving result accuracy for niche or custom product names.

Once enabled, click on **Add Keywords** to override specific keywords to stop suggesting similar queries. Below is use case scenarios accepted for Spellcheck override.
