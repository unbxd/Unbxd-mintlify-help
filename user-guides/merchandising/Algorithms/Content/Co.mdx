**Search** is at the heart of any successful eCommerce experience. When shoppers visit your site, they expect to find relevant products quickly—even if their search query is misspelled, unclear, or slightly off-target. That’s where **Netcore Unbxd’s AI-powered search algorithms** come in. They are designed to understand shopper intent and deliver accurate, relevant results in real-time.

However, every business is unique. You may use specific product terms, naming conventions, or customer language that our default AI models may not fully understand right out of the box. That’s why the **Content** feature in the **Algorithms** section of the Unbxd Console gives you the flexibility to customize how search understands your site’s language.

**<u>Why Use the Content Section?</u>**

The Content section allows you to add **site-specific dictionaries** to help Unbxd algorithms better interpret your unique product catalog and customer behavior. This ensures that your search results stay relevant, even in edge cases. By configuring key content types like **Synonyms**, **Phrases**, **Stemming**, **Concepts**, **Stop Words**, and **Spellcheck**, you can improve the accuracy and performance of your on-site search.

Let’s take a quick look at what each of these content types does:

<Accordion title="Synonyms" icon="sparkles">
  Match similar words so that a search for "pants" also shows results for "trousers." This ensures shoppers always see relevant options, no matter which term they use.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Phrases" icon="sparkles">
  Help the algorithm understand multi-word terms as a single product type. For example, “shoe polish” should return polish used for shoes—not shoes themselves.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stemming" icon="sparkles">
  This overrides the default word stemming. For instance, “bedding” might otherwise be reduced to “bed,” leading to irrelevant results. You can customize this behavior as needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Concepts" icon="sparkles">
  Highlight important keywords in a search query that must be included in the results. For example, for the query “red sofa,” the product must be a **sofa,** and the color should be **red**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stop Words" icon="sparkles">
  Ignore common words like “for,” “of,” or “if” that don’t add value to the search ranking. This helps the algorithm focus on meaningful terms.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Spellcheck" icon="sparkles">
  Automatically corrects typos or misspellings to return the right results. For example, a search for “rd drss” will still return products for “red dress”.
</Accordion>

**<u>Why It Matters?</u>**

By customizing these content rules, you help the search engine better understand your catalog and shopper intent—leading to **higher relevancy**, **better conversions**, and **improved user experience**.

In the next sections, we'll explain how to **add, edit, or delete** each type of content entry using the Unbxd Console.

> 💡 **Tip:** You can also create query rules that target a primary search keyword along with additional keywords.
