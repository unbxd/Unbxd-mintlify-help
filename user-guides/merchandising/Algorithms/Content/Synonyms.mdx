## Overview
The **Synonyms** section in the Netcore Unbxd console helps ensure that shoppers find what they're looking for—even if they use different words, regional terms, misspellings, or abbreviations in their search. By defining synonyms, you connect related or equivalent terms so that shoppers receive relevant results for a variety of query styles.

This is especially helpful in reducing **zero-result searches**, improving **product discoverability**, and ensuring a **consistent search experience** across different shopper intents.

**When Are Synonyms Used?**

Synonyms come into play in several everyday search scenarios:

- **Terms with the Same Meaning**
  Words like _"ladies"_ and _"women's"_ or _"graph paper"_ and _"grid paper"_ refer to the same thing and should return the same products.
- **Geographically Different Terms**
  Shoppers in different regions may use different words for the same product. For example, _"slippers"_ in India are often referred to as _"flip-flops"_ in the US. Mapping these terms ensures search results remain relevant regardless of location.
- **Related Terms**
Even if two terms are not exact synonyms, they may be closely related in context. A search for _"paper plates"_ could also show _"plastic plates"_ as relevant alternatives.
- **Hyponyms**
  A more specific term (like _"desktop PC"_) can be mapped to a broader category (_"computers"_) to expand results meaningfully.
- **Spelling Variants**
  Differences in dialect or preference can lead to spelling variants like _"color"_ vs _"colour"_ or _"adapter"_ vs _"adaptor"_. These should be treated as equivalent.
- **Common Misspellings**
  Shoppers may frequently misspell brand names or product terms—e.g., _"purel"_ instead of _"Purell"_. Adding such synonyms ensures they still see the right products.
- **Spacing Variations**
  Words like _"WiFi"_, _"Wi-Fi"_, and _"Wi Fi"_ are visually different but semantically the same. Handling such variations is key to delivering consistent results.
- **Abbreviations**
  Shoppers may search using abbreviations like _"MK"_ for _"Michael Kors"_ or _"NYC"_ for _"New York City"_. Mapping these helps return complete and relevant results.
