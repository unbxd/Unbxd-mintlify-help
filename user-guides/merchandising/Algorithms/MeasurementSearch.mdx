This feature empowers you to perform precise searches based on measurable product attributes such as size, weight, price, product Info, or pressure. This functionality allows for fine-tuning search results by defining a search strategy & configuring dimensional attributes with measurable units. For example, in a search query "**10** is a dimension that will pull out the results based on the query.

### Enable Measurement Search

1. Navigate to Unbxd console \> Algorithm \> Intent \> Measurement Search
2. Click on the CTA button to enable the Measurement Search.
3. Once the feature is enabled, the Customer is set to use the Measurement search for the search-related queries.

4. Strategy Selection: You can select either the strategy offered below:

   | Strategy | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
   | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Boost    | In this mode, products within the specified measurement range are given higher prominence in search results. For example, if a shopper searches for a washing machine with a capacity of 7 kg, and only 7.5 kg machines are in stock, the 7.5 kg models will be boosted in the search results. |
   | Filter   | In this mode, the measurement-related attributes (e.g., size, weight, dimensions) are identified and exact same products are filtered in the search result.                                                                                                                                    |
5. Configure Attributes: This section enables search using measurable attributes. You must select the attributes from the catalog and map the dimensions and units accordingly. You can add up to 5 attributes per dimension type. Currently we support following units:

   | Dimension    | Unit                                                                                                             |
   | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Price        | usd, aud, cad, sgd, gbp, cent, $, €, £, ₹                                                                        |
   | Size         | mm, cm, m, mi, in, ft, mm2, cm2, m2, mi2, in2, ft2, mm3, cm3, m3, mi3, in3, ft3, l, fl oz, gal, qt, pt, bbl, tsp |
   | Weight       | mg, g, kg, lb, oz                                                                                                |
   | Pressure     | pa, kpa, atm, torr, bar, psi, mmhg, psia, psig, ksi                                                              |
   | Product Info | b, kb, mb, gb, tb, pb, eb, ib, kib, mib, gib, tib, pib, eib                                                      |
6. **Default Configuration**: This is used to power the queries that do not have a dimension attribute.\
   For example, your search query is "**red shirt under 10**". \
   Here, the user/merchandiser must set up a default dimension (Price or Size, in this case) so that the search result displays products with a price less than $10 or products with a size less than ten.
7. **Tolerance configuration**: It is a flexibility factor which gives you better search results.\
   Currently, the query builder follows a configurable normalization range of ±10%.
