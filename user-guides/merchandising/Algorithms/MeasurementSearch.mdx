This feature empowers you to perform precise searches based on measurable product attributes such as size, weight, price, product Info, or pressure. This functionality allows for fine-tuning search results by defining a search strategy & configuring dimensional attributes with measurable units. For example, in a search query "**10$ red dress**", **10$** is a dimension that will pull out the results based on the query.

   | Boost    | In this mode, products within the specified measurement range are given higher prominence in search results. For example, if a shopper searches for a washing machine with a capacity of 7 kg, and only 7.5 kg machines are in stock, the 7.5 kg models will be boosted in the search results. |
   | Filter   | In this mode, the measurement-related attributes (e.g., size, weight, dimensions) are identified and exact same products are filtered in the search result.                                                                                                                                    |
