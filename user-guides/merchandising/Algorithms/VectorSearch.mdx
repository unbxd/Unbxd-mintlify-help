**Vector Search** is a powerful feature in Unbxd that enhances product discovery and improves the relevance of search results. Unlike traditional keyword-based search systems, which rely on exact word matches, vector search allows Unbxd to understand the **Intent** behind a user's query and find the most relevant products, even if they don't contain the exact words searched for.
It works best with long-tailed queries.

### Enable Vector Search

1. Navigate to Unbxd console \> Algorithm \> Intent \> Vector Search
2. Click on the "Contact support" link, which will auto create a ticket for enabling this feature at the product end for approval. Post that the toggle button will be in an active state for the customer.
3. Once the feature is enabled, the Customer is set to use the Vector search for the search related queries.

#### What to Expect After Enabling

- After the feature is enabled, **Vector Search** will become available for your search queries.
- The system will automatically handle the vectorization of product data and user queries, so you donâ€™t need to manually configure anything else.
- Your search results will be ranked based on semantic meaning rather than exact keyword matches, offering more accurate and contextually relevant products to your users.
