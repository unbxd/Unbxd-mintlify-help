Segmentation categorizes customers into groups based on shopping history, geographic location, device type, and other attributes. This enables targeted marketing and merchandising strategies. \
\
In eCommerce, merchandiser uses segmentation to display products more relevant to a customer's specific segment. For example, showing trending products to new visitors or recommending items based on past views for returning customers.

**Unbxd's Role:** Unbxd provides a platform to create and manage these segments. It allows configuring attributes (like location, device, user type) and custom attributes

## Types of Segments

Segments are defined based on:

1. **Location**: Analyze purchasing patterns across different regions. Recommend products with lower shipping costs based on shopper locations.
2. **Devices**: Identify purchasing trends across different devices. Track cross-device purchases and personalize each channel’s experience.
3. **Visit Type**: Differentiate between first-time and returning shoppers. Display trending products for new visitors and recently viewed or recommended products for returning shoppers.
4. **Custom Attributes**: They are included in the search API request to segment shoppers based on specific requirements.
