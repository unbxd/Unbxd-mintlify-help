Segmentation categorizes customers into groups based on shopping history, geographic location, device type, and other attributes. This enables targeted marketing and merchandising strategies. 
Unbxd provides a platform to create and manage segments, allowing the configuration of predefined and custom attributes such as location, device, and user type.

## Types of Segments

Segments are defined based on:
1. **Location** : Analyze purchasing patterns across different regions. Recommend products with lower shipping costs based on shopper locations.
2. **Devices** : Identify purchasing trends across different devices. Track cross-device purchases and personalize each channel’s experience.
3. **Visit Type** : Differentiate between first-time and returning shoppers. Display trending products for new visitors and recently viewed or recommended products for returning shoppers.
4. **Custom Attributes** : They are included in the search API request to segment shoppers based on specific requirement.
