## Promote suggestions

Promoted Suggestions in Autosuggest are predefined query suggestions that merchants can prioritize to appear at the top of the Autosuggest dropdown. These suggestions help drive attention to specific search terms or campaigns, enabling a more targeted shopping experience.

Promoted suggestions are beneficial for:

* Highlighting specific keywords for seasonal sales, promotions, or new product launches.
* Driving traffic to categories or products that need more visibility.
* Aligning autosuggest queries with business goals, ensuring shoppers are directed to high-priority areas.

Promoted suggestions will appear in the search dropdown when the shopper's query includes a string of letters that matches any part of the terms you’ve added as promoted suggestions.

For example:
If you’ve added "Running Shoes" as a promoted suggestion:

* It will appear for queries like "Run", "Running", or "Shoes".
* It will not appear for unrelated queries like "Sandals", "Jackets", or "Hiking Gear", as these terms do not match any part of the promoted suggestion.

## Block Suggestions

Blacklisted suggestions in Autosuggest are query terms that merchants choose to exclude from appearing in the Autosuggest dropdown. These terms may be removed to prevent irrelevant, outdated, or undesired suggestions from showing up, ensuring a more refined and appropriate shopping experience.

Blacklisted suggestions are beneficial for:

* Avoiding irrelevant keywords: Excluding terms that do not align with the product catalog or business goals.
* Preventing sensitive or restricted terms: Removing words that may be inappropriate or prohibited.
* Improving the relevance of autosuggest results: Ensuring only meaningful and shopper-relevant queries are shown.

Blacklisted suggestions will not appear in the Autosuggest dropdown if the shopper's query includes any part of the terms you’ve blacklisted.

Example:

If you’ve blacklisted the term "Expired Deals," it will not appear for any queries.
