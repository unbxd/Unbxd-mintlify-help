# Overview

**Navik**, the Netcore Unbxd Shopping Assistant, is an AI-driven chatbot integrated into e-commerce websites. It assists customers by understanding their preferences, guiding them in product selection, and offering tailored suggestions based on their interactions with the site.

<Info>
  1. Netcore Unbxd's Shopping Assistant is a **_PAID_** feature and is not included by default in the standard Unbxd Panel.
  2. Merchandisers do not have access to enable this feature, contact **Unbxd Business Team** to enable this feature for your panel.
</Info>

### Key Features of a Shopping Assistant:

1. **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on user queries, browsing behavior, and past interactions, the assistant suggests products that the user will likely be interested in.
2. **Real-time Interaction**: It engages users in real-time conversations, offering immediate answers to questions about products, shipping details, availability, and more.
3. **Search Assistance**: It helps users refine their search by applying filters (e.g., size, color, brand) or guiding them through a product catalog.
4. **Product Discovery**: If the user is unsure about what to buy, the assistant offers curated product options, helping users explore a variety of choices.

### Why is a Shopping Assistant Useful?

1. **Improved Customer Experience**:

   By offering immediate assistance, personalized product suggestions, and easy navigation, shopping assistants make the shopping process more intuitive and enjoyable for users. This leads to higher customer satisfaction.
2. **Increased Conversions and Sales**:

   Personalized product recommendations can directly influence purchasing decisions. By presenting the right products at the right time, a shopping assistant can drive higher conversion rates and more sales.
3. **24/7 Availability**:

   Unlike human customer support, a shopping assistant is always available, providing instant responses to users' queries at any time of the day. This is particularly useful for global ecommerce platforms where users might be browsing at different times.
4. **Efficient Handling of Queries**:

   The assistant can handle a large volume of queries simultaneously, reducing the need for human agents. It can answer repetitive questions like product details, availability, price, and shipping, freeing up customer support staff to focus on more complex issues and so on.

## Integration of Shopping Assistant to Netcore Unbxd console.

We support the following two methods for integrating the Shopping Assistant: an API-driven approach for more control and flexibility, and a simpler JavaScript (JS) embedding method.

# API-Driven Implementation

This method allows for greater control and customization of the integration by making API calls from your backend or frontend to interact with the Shopping Assistant.

#### 1. Initialize Conversation

**Purpose**: This API call initiates a new conversation session for a unique user on your website, establishing a context for future interactions.

**Endpoint**:

```
GET /v1/sites/{site_key}/conversation?uid={netcoreid}
```

**Parameters**:

| **Parameter Type**  | **Parameter** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Required** |

| **Query Parameter** | `uid`         | A unique identifier for the current user on your website.

# **JS Script Embedding Implementation**

This method offers a faster and simpler way to integrate the Shopping Assistant by embedding a JavaScript script and a CSS file into your website.

To implement using the JS script, include the following in your website's **\<head\>** or **\<body\>**:

**HTML:**

```filename
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/unbxd-shopping-assistant.css">

<script src="https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/unbxd-shopping-assistant.js"></script>
```
