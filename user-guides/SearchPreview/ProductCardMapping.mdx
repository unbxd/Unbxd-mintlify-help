## Overview

The **Product Card Viewer** in Unbxd helps merchandisers and teams visualize how products will appear to shoppers on the **Search** or **Browse Preview** pages. It ensures the most important product information is front and center, so decision-making is faster, easier, and more efficient.

### Why use Product Card Viewer?

When configured correctly, it allows you to see all the key product details at a glance like how your shoppers would see them on your live site. This includes critical product attributes such as:

- **Product Title** : The product's name is clearly displayed to help customers identify and understand the product.
- **Price** : The cost of the product is prominently shown to inform customers about its price.
- **Product Image** : The link to the product's image ensures a visual representation is displayed on the product card.
- Plus any **additional fields** that matter to your business, such as **Size** and **delivery date**.

Below is how the merchandiser will be notified if any attribute is missing from the mapping.

- These attributes are essential because they directly impact the user's ability to understand the product and purchase.

When **Product Mapping** is correctly configured, the **Search Preview** or **Browse Preview** will display products in a seamless, clear, and compelling way.

Below is how the product preview will look if the mapping is configured correctly.
