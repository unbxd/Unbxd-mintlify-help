## Overview

Product card mapping is a critical process where the system displays relevant information about a product in the search or browse preview. This mapping ensures that all necessary product attributes, such as size, price, brand, and dimensions, are correctly displayed on the product card.

**Dimension Mapping Attributes** are specific fields in the product data that are mapped to display the relevant attributes in the product card. When the user goes to **Search Preview** or **Browse Preview**, if any required dimension mapping attribute is missing, a pop-up notification will be displayed.

Three key attributes are fundamental to ensuring that product cards display the most important information in a **Search Preview** or **Browse Preview**:

1. **Product Title**: The product's name is clearly displayed to help customers identify and understand the product.
2. **Selling Price**: The cost of the product is prominently shown to inform customers about its price.
3. **Image URL**: The link to the product's image ensures a visual representation is displayed on the product card.

4. **Additional Fields**: In this field, you can map attributes that the user would want to see in the Search or Browse preview, such as **Size** and **delivery date**.

These attributes are essential because they directly impact the user's ability to understand the product and purchase.\
When **Product Mapping** and **Dimension Mapping** are correctly configured, the **Search Preview** or **Browse Preview** will display products in a seamless, clear, and compelling way.\
This is how the product preview will look if the mapping is configured correctly.\
