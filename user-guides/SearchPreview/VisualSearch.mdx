## Overview

**Unbxd Visual Search** allows shoppers to find products by uploading an image instead of typing a search query. It uses advanced **AI and computer vision** to analyze the image, extract relevant attributes (like color, category, texture, etc.), and surface visually similar products from your catalog in real-time.

### Prerequisites

1. You should have a valid **UNBXD account** with appropriate permissions to access the **Self-Serve Console**.
2. **Visual Search** must be enabled on your UNBXD panel.

   <Info>
     Note:
     1. Visual Search is a **_PAID_** feature and is not included by default in the standard Unbxd Panel.
     2. Merchandisers do not have access to enable this feature, contact **Unbxd Business Team** to enable this feature for your panel.
   </Info>

## How to use Visual Search

1. Navigate to the Search Preview of your console.
2. In the Search Preview, click on the camera icon to open the Visual Search panel.
3. You can choose your input in **two ways** for a search:
   - Upload an Image File from your device (Supports standard image files like JPEG, PNG, and so on)
   - Paste an Image URL to see similar items

4. Once the image is processed the image is displayed on the left as the **anchor image.**

   It will include **interactive markers (dots)** on different product areas detected in the image.
5. Click on any **marker (dot)** to view products similar to that item. For example: Click on a marker over shoes to see similar shoes from the catalog.

<Note>
  Markers help pinpoint specific items in a multi-product image. For example, If in an image, a model wearing a dress and shoes, you would see markers over both.

  - Click the **dress marker** to see similar dresses.
  - Click the **shoe marker** to see similar shoes.
</Note>

## Managing the Visual Search

- Click on "Delete" icon to **delete the current image** and re-upload or provide a new image URL.
- Each time you upload or paste an image, a new anchor image and markers will appear.

## Conclusion

Unbxd Visual Search revolutionizes the way shoppers interact with your site by enabling search through images rather than text. By leveraging AI and computer vision, it helps users quickly discover products that visually match their preferences without the need to know specific product names or descriptions.

This feature is especially useful for fashion, home d√©cor, and other visually-driven categories, where appearance plays a crucial role in purchase decisions. With support for both image uploads and URLs, Visual Search enhances product discoverability, reduces zero-result searches, and delivers a faster, more intuitive shopping experience.
