# Overview

The **Attribute Enrichment** in the console aims to enhance catalog completeness for optimal search performance. This dashboard facilitates the identification of missing or incomplete attributes in product catalogs, providing detailed metrics and allowing merchandisers to prioritize enrichment efforts. It presents various attributes, their status, and their impact on search performance.

## Why is this Useful?

Merchandisers often struggle with incomplete or inconsistent product data, such as missing attributes for key categories like **material** for a **T-shirt** or **screen size** for a **Smartwatch**. These gaps can lead to:

\* **Poor Search Relevance**: Customers might not find products if key attributes are missing.

\* **Reduced Discoverability**: Filters and facets relying on these attributes won't function effectively.

\* **Inconsistent Product Information**: Leading to a fragmented customer experience.

## Product Enrichment Strategies

The Netcore Unbxd console offers four core enrichment strategies to help you optimize and enhance your product catalog.

1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**

This strategy harnesses the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to intelligently generate new, missing product fields based on existing information in your catalog. It's ideal for creating descriptive content or structured data points that are not readily available.

For Example: For a **"Smartwatch"** missing the "battery life" attribute, the LLM analyzes the product description, such as "Up to 48 hours of usage on a single charge," and automatically adds the missing "battery life" data.

2. **Google Translator Enrichment**

This strategy enables the translation of existing product fields from one language (typically English) into a specified target language. It helps expand your e-commerce presence into new markets and provides localized search experiences by generating multilingual product data.

For Example: **Original Product Data**

<CodeGroup>

```Original Product Block
{  
  "id": "PROD123",  
  "product_type": "Smartwatch",  
  "enr_unx_ar_translate_product_type": "ساعة ذكية"  
} 
```


```Enriched Product Data (after translation)
{  
  "id": "PROD123",  
  "product_type": "Smartwatch",  
  "enr_unx_ar_translate_product_type": "ساعة ذكية"  
} 
```

</CodeGroup>

3. **Transliterate Enrichment**

The Transliterate Enrichment strategy converts text from one script to another while preserving phonetic pronunciation. This is especially useful for search queries where users might type foreign words using English characters. It differs from translation by changing the script, not the meaning.

For Example : 1. **English to Hindi Transliteration**

<CodeGroup>

```Original Product Block
{  
  "id": "GROCERY456",  
  "product_name": "Chawal"  
}  
```


```Enriched Product Data (after Transliterate processing):
{  
  "id": "GROCERY456",  
  "product_name": "Chawal",  
  "enr_unx_hi_translit_product_name": "Rice"  
}  
```

</CodeGroup>

For Example: 2. **Latin Script - Similar to Translation**

<CodeGroup>

```Original Product Block
{  
  "id": "PROD123",  
  "product_type": "Smartwatch"  
}  
```


````Enriched Product Data (after Transliterate processing):
{  
  "id": "PROD123",  
  "product_type": "Smartwatch",  
  "enr_unx_es_translit_product_type": "Reloj inteligente"  
}  
```  | 

This format simplifies the explanation and example for users, making it easy to understand the functionality of the **Transliterate Enrichment** strategy.

</CodeGroup>

4. **SEO Keyword Enrichment**:

The SEO Keyword Enrichment strategy uses Large Language Models (LLM) to generate relevant SEO keywords for your products based on existing product data. These keywords help improve your product's visibility in organic search results, driving more traffic to your e-commerce site.

For Example: **Configuration from fields: product_title, description, category**

<CodeGroup>

```Original Product Block
{  
  "id": "PROD789",  
  "product_title": "Organic Cotton Baby Bodysuit",  
  "description": "Soft and breathable 100% organic cotton bodysuit for infants aged 0-6 months. Features snap closures for easy diaper changes and a cute animal print. Perfect for sensitive skin.",  
  "category": "Baby Clothing"  
} 
```


````Enriched Product Data (after SEO Keyword processing)
{  
  "id": "PROD789",  
  "product_title": "Organic Cotton Baby Bodysuit",  
  "description": "Soft and breathable 100% organic cotton bodysuit for infants aged 0-6 months. Features snap closures for easy diaper changes and a cute animal print. Perfect for sensitive skin.",  
  "category": "Baby Clothing",  
  "seo_keywords": [  
    "organic baby clothes",  
    "cotton bodysuit infant",  
    "newborn organic cotton",  
    "baby clothes 0-6 months",  
    "snap closure bodysuit",  
    "sensitive skin baby clothes",  
    "animal print baby outfit"  
  ]  
}  
```  |

This format breaks down how the SEO Keyword Enrichment strategy works, providing a simple explanation and an example of how it generates SEO keywords from product data.

## Dashboard Keywords and Their Functionality

**Attribute Enrichment** improves the discoverability of your products by ensuring that your product catalog has the necessary and complete attributes. There are three metrics of the **Attribute Enrichment**

| **Metric**             | **Description**                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Total Dimensions**   | The total number of attributes being tracked for enrichment in your product catalog.                               |
| **Missing Dimensions** | The number of attributes that are currently missing or incomplete in the catalog and need to be enriched.          |
| **Mapped Dimensions**  | The attributes that have been successfully mapped to the system, meaning they are linked and ready for enrichment. |

This below section on the dashboard, helps you monitor the overall progress of your attribute enrichment process and provides clarity on which attributes are ready, which ones are missing, and how many are already mapped for enrichment.

| **Section**             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Use Case**                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Can I apply enrichment to only a subset of products?">
  Currently, enrichment is applied to all relevant products within a mapped category. However, you can use filters before running enrichment to narrow down which attributes or product types you want to focus on.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does enrichment overwrite existing data?">
  No. Enrichment is designed to fill in only missing or empty fields

  . It will not overwrite existing attribute values unless explicitly configured to do so in a custom implementation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is manual review required after enrichment?">
  While manual review is not mandatory, it is highly recommended

  . You can review enriched outputs via the sample preview, download the file, make edits, and re-upload before publishing changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I export enriched attribute data?">
  Yes. You can download enriched data

  during the review stage before publishing, which lets you export, validate, or modify attribute values offline.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is enrichment available for custom attributes?">
  Yes. As long as your custom attribute is mapped correctly

  to the system and is relevant to a product category, it can be enriched using any of the supported strategies.
</Accordion>
