### What is Product Badging?

Product Badging is a visual labeling feature within the Unbxd Search Console’s Merchandising Workbench. It enables merchants to highlight specific products on the product cards with badges such as **"Sponsored"**, **"Special Edition"**, **"Sale"**, and more. These badges serve as quick, intuitive signals that help guide customers through your catalog, enhance product visibility, and ultimately drive higher conversions without altering your inventory.

Badges play a critical role in e-commerce by:

- **Attracting Attention:** Highlight important product attributes or promotions.
- **Facilitating Faster Decisions:** Help shoppers quickly identify product status or special offers.
- **Increasing Sales:** Leverage existing traffic more effectively by promoting key products.
