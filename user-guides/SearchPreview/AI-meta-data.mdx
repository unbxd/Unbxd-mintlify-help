## Overview

**AI Metadata** is a smart feature in Unbxd that automatically adds important information (called attributes) to your product listings using **Artificial Intelligence**.\
It decodes complex search queries to help shoppers find exactly what they want. It looks at your product titles, descriptions, and other content to figure out things like: **Color, Material, Style**, **Fit**, **Occasion,** and so on.

For example, if a product is titled “Elegant black evening dress with lace”, Unbxd’s AI will automatically extract:

- **Color**: Black
- **Style**: Evening
- **Material**: Lace
- **Occasion**: Formal

These attributes get added to your catalog as **metadata**, which helps improve how this product shows up in search or filtering. Even if this info isn’t manually added to your product catalog, **AI Metadata can detect it automatically.**\
Merchandiser would want to **what are the factors that impact users search result. Which model**\
**this is part of improving the debuggability of the model for the merchandiser**

In Debug view, you would be able to see the below:\
-Site Perfomance: It measures how fast and efficiently the site responds to search requests. For example: Search results loaded in 130ms.\
-Query Performace: This tracks how well a specific search query performs in terms of speed and relevance._for example:_  if a user searches for “leather boots” the webite took 120ms and returned 25 results. 120ms & 25 results are the attribules of Query performance\
-Relevancy: Indicates how closely a product matches the user's search intent and query terms. For_example:\_  A product has 4/5 relevancy score for “wireless earbuds”.\
-Performance(if enabled) : Displays user engagement metrics like clicks, add-to-cart, and conversions per product.\
_Example:_ A product has a 5% conversion rate from searches in the last 7 days.\
\
These factors collectively contribute to the Score (final product score), which determines the product's ranking in search results.

AI Models: The models that influence the overall search result:

1. Content Model: The Content Model analyzes your product catalog to understand what each product is, based on its attributes like title, description, brand, color, size, material, and so on.\
   It structures and enriches product data to improve discoverability. 
2. Intent Model: The Intent Model interprets what the shopper _really_ means when they type a search query even if it’s not phrased perfectly. Refer here for details of Intent Model
3. Ranking Model
4. Fallback Model : if none of the above model works for the search query, the search reult will be empowered by the Fallback Model.
