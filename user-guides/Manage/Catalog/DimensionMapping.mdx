## Overview

In **UNBXD**, **dimension mapping** refers to mapping various attributes or characteristics of a product to specific filters, facets, or categories that help users refine their search results or navigate product listings. **Dimensions** in UNBXD are typically product attributes such as:

- **Brand**
- **Price**
- **Size**
- **Color**
- **Category**
- **Material**
- **Ratings**
- **Discount**

UNBXD enables you to map these attributes (which serve as your dimensions) to search filters and facets, allowing users to refine their search and find products that match their preferences.

**For Example:**

- When you define the **brand** as a **dimension** in UNBXD, users can filter results by brands.
- Similarly, **price range** can be mapped to allow users to filter products by specific price bands.

### Map Product Attributes

The **mapping process** ensures that these attributes are correctly recognized and used for creating dynamic filters in your search or product listing pages. This enhances the search experience by enabling users to easily drill down into product categories.

1. Navigate to **Manage** \> **Catalog** \> **Dimension Mapping.**
2. Dimension Mapping is divided into two categories:
   - **Essential Fields**: These are the basic fields typically needed for product listings and search functionality.

## Product Card Mapping

Product card mapping is a critical process where the system displays relevant information about a product in the search or browse preview. This mapping ensures that all necessary product attributes, such as size, price, brand, and dimensions, are correctly displayed on the product card.

**Dimension Mapping Attributes** are specific fields in the product data that are mapped to display the relevant attributes in the product card. When the user goes to **Search Preview** or **Browse Preview**, if any required dimension mapping attribute is missing, a pop-up notification will be displayed.

![Productcardmapping Pn](/images/Productcardmapping.png)

Three key attributes are fundamental to ensuring that product cards display the most important information in a **Search Preview** or **Browse Preview**:

1. **Product Title**: The product's name is clearly displayed to help customers identify and understand the product.
2. **Selling Price**: The cost of the product is prominently shown to inform customers about its price.
3. **Image URL**: The link to the product's image ensures a visual representation is displayed on the product card.

   ![Productcardmapping New Pn](/images/Productcardmapping_new.png)
4. **Additional Fields**: In this field, you can map attributes that the user would want to see in the Search or Browse preview, such as **Size** and **delivery date**.

These attributes are essential because they directly impact the user's ability to understand the product and purchase.\
When **Product Mapping** and **Dimension Mapping** are correctly configured, the **Search Preview** or **Browse Preview** will display products in a seamless, clear, and compelling way.\
This is how the product preview will look if the mapping is configured correctly.\

**Dimension Mapping** and **Product Card Mapping** are critical for optimizing the e-commerce experience. They not only enhance product visibility and search accuracy but also help businesses deliver a high-quality, customer-friendly shopping environment that drives conversions and fosters long-term trust. By paying attention to these mappings, businesses can offer a seamless, engaging, and efficient product discovery process for their customers.

## Troubleshoot & FAQs

<Accordion title="What happens if I update my product feed—do I need to remap attributes?" icon="sparkles">
  No, once your dimension and product card mappings are set, you only need to ensure new feed fields follow the same naming and structure. If new fields are added, map them accordingly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Some of the product filters missing in Search or Browse Preview" icon="sparkles">
  This could be because the required product attributes are not correctly mapped in **Dimension Mapping **or the attribute values are missing in your product feed.\
  Go to **Manage \> Catalog \> Dimension Mapping** and ensure the attributes are listed under **Essential Fields** or **Vertical Fields**.\
  Ensure your product feed includes valid data for those attributes you want to use as filters or facets.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I seeing a popup warning about missing dimension mapping attributes" icon="sparkles">
  Check the required attributes (like **Title**, **Image URL**, or **Selling Price**) are missing either in your feed or in your mapping configuration. Review your **Dimension Mapping** to ensure all required fields are mapped. Re-upload your product feed and confirm that the values for the essential attributes are present.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My attribute filters behaving unexpectedly" icon="sparkles">
  The field types might be incorrectly configured (e.g., a number stored as text). Fields intended for filtering may not be marked as **Facetable**.\
  Check that the field type matches its intended use (e.g., price should be numeric). Ensure the field is marked as **Facetable** in the backend.\
  If the issue persists, contact **Unbxd Support** for further assistance.
