## Overview

In **UNBXD**, **dimension mapping** refers to mapping various attributes or characteristics of a product to specific filters, facets, or categories that help users refine their search results or navigate product listings. **Dimensions** in UNBXD are typically product attributes such as:

- **Brand**
- **Price**
- **Size**
- **Color**
- **Category**
- **Material**
- **Ratings**
- **Discount**

UNBXD enables you to map these attributes (which serve as your dimensions) to search filters and facets, allowing users to refine their search and find products that match their preferences.

**For Example:**

- When you define the **brand** as a **dimension** in UNBXD, users can filter results by brands.
- Similarly, **price range** can be mapped to allow users to filter products by specific price bands.

### Map Product Attributes

The **mapping process** ensures that these attributes are correctly recognized and used for creating dynamic filters in your search or product listing pages. This enhances the search experience by enabling users to easily drill down into product categories.

1. Navigate to **Manage** \> **Catalog** \> **Dimension Mapping.**
2. Dimension Mapping is divided into two categories:
   - **Essential Fields**: These are the basic fields typically needed for product listings and search functionality
   - Vertical Field: These are additional fields specific to the **apparel** category
