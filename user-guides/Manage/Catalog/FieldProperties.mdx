The **Field Configuration** feature has been introduced to streamline the management of fields within your catalog. Over time, businesses can accumulate many irrelevant and unused fields that affect the efficiency of search and browse operations, particularly when creating promotions, facets, and banners. These excessive fields increase API costs, consume unnecessary resources, and degrade system performance.

Imagine you are a merchandiser managing an online catalog. You have many fields that are not used for promotions, banners, or facets, but they are still part of the catalog's backend. As a result, you face higher costs due to the unnecessary API calls, and your system is slowed down due to indexing irrelevant fields. With **Field Configuration**, you can easily manage and streamline which fields are used for specific operations, optimizing your workflow and saving on API costs.

## Key Features of Field Configuration

- **Optimization**: Reduces unnecessary field usage by limiting fields to only those necessary for operations such as promotions, facets, or autosuggest features.
- **Performance Boost**: By reducing the number of active fields, it helps in improving the overall system performance by lowering indexing times and reducing API load.
- **Cost Savings**: Minimizes API calls and reduces operational costs by restricting the number of active fields.

## Field Config Properties

The **Field Configuration** feature offers several key properties that allow you to manage fields effectively. Navigate to \*\* Manage \*\* \> \*\* Catalog \*\* \>**Field Properties**  from Unbxd console.

- **Feature Types**:\
  Merchandisers can assign specific tags to fields, such as:
  - **"Merchandisable"**: This field will only be available in the promotion section.
  - **"Facetable"**: This field will appear in the facets and banners section.
  - **"Autosuggest"**: This field will appear in keyword suggestions, infield suggestions, and in search fields under the popular products section.
- **Usability**:\
  The **Field Configuration** feature supports both **single-select** and **multi-select** operations, allowing bulk field management for efficient workflows.

<Info>
  - Only the fields actively used in rule/campaign creation for promotions will remain **"Merchandisable"**.
  - Only the fields used under facets and banners will remain **"Facetable"**.
  - Only the fields used in keyword suggestions and search fields for popular products will remain **"Autosuggest"**.
