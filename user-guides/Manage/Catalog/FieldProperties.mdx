---

The **Field Configuration** feature has been introduced to streamline the management of fields within your catalog. Over time, businesses can accumulate many irrelevant and unused fields that affect the efficiency of search and browse operations, particularly when creating promotions, facets, and banners. These excessive fields increase API costs, consume unnecessary resources, and degrade system performance.

Imagine you are a merchandiser managing an online catalog. You have many fields that are not used for promotions, banners, or facets, but they are still part of the catalog's backend. As a result, you face higher costs due to the unnecessary API calls, and your system is slowed down due to indexing irrelevant fields. With **Field Configuration**, you can easily manage and streamline which fields are used for specific operations, optimizing your workflow and saving on API costs.

## Key Features of Field Configuration

- **Optimization**: Reduces unnecessary field usage by limiting fields to only those necessary for operations such as promotions, facets, or autosuggest features.
- **Performance Boost**: By reducing the number of active fields, it helps in improving the overall system performance by lowering indexing times and reducing API load.
- **Cost Savings**: Minimizes API calls and reduces operational costs by restricting the number of active fields.

## Field Config Properties

The **Field Configuration** feature offers several key properties that allow you to manage fields effectively. 

1. Navigate to **Manage**  \> **Catalog** \>**Field Properties**  from Unbxd console.

- **Feature Types**:\
  Merchandisers can assign specific tags to fields, such as:
  - **"Merchandisable"**: This field will only be available in the promotion section in [Filter](https://docs.netcoreunbxd.com/user-guides/merchandising/promotions/filter).
  - **"Facetable"**: This field will appear in the facets and banners section.
  - **"Autosuggest"**: This field will appear in keyword suggestions, infield suggestions, and search fields under the popular products section.
- **Usability**:\
  The **Field Configuration** feature supports both **single-select** and **multi-select** operations, allowing bulk field management for efficient workflows.

<Info>
  **Important Points to Remember:**

  - Only fields used in **Promotion** rules or campaigns will be kept as **Merchandisable**.
  - Only fields used in **Facets **or **Banners **will be kept as **Facetable**.
  - Only fields used in keyword **Suggestions** or Search will be kept as **Autosuggest**.

### 4. Sync the field properties

Once you’ve enabled or disabled features, click the **Sync** button. This ensures that changes are reflected and indexed correctly. Without syncing, the feed won’t be indexed, which may lead to delays in applying the feature changes.

### 5. Ability to bulk export/import Field Configurations

The **Bulk Export/Import Field Configurations** feature allows users to manage and migrate field configuration settings efficiently across different environments. Bulk export/import enables you to streamline field management tasks. This feature saves time and effort by enabling easy migration of field settings while ensuring consistency and accuracy.

With **Bulk Export/Import**, users can:

- **Export** field configurations from the platform into a structured format (such as CSV or Excel), allowing for offline review or backup.
- **Import** field configurations back into the system, making it easier to apply pre-defined configurations across multiple fields without having to manually edit them one by one.

### 6. Action Button

Follow these steps to configure your fields and enable necessary features:

1. Select Fields to Modify: Select one or more fields that need to be enabled for specific features.
2. **Bulk Enable Features**: Click on the **Action** button and from the dropdown, click on **"Bulk Enable Features"**. A pop-up will appear where you can select the feature (e.g., **"Merchandisable"**, **"Facetable"**, or **"Autosuggest"**).
3. Click **Bulk Enable** to activate the features for the selected fields.
4. **Bulk Disable Features**: If you need to disable a feature for a field, follow the same steps and select **Bulk Disable Features** from the dropdown menu.

    2. **Update the Feed**:\
       If the attribute is missing, initiate a new feed containing the required attribute. Wait for the indexing cycle to complete.
    3. **Sync the Feed**:\
       After the feed is indexed, click on the **refresh icon** again to ensure the attribute is updated.
    4. **Tag the Attribute**:\
       Once the attribute is available, tag it with the appropriate property for the dropdown context.

  <Accordion title=" Importing Fields with Errors" icon="sparkles" iconType="solid">
    If you receive an error during import:

    - **Check for Format Issues**: Ensure the file format is correct (CSV or Excel) and the required columns (e.g., Field Name, Feature Tag, Enabled) are included.
    - **Feature Tag Mismatch**: Verify that the feature tags in the import file match the predefined tags in the system (e.g., **Merchandisable**, **Facetable**, **Autosuggest**).
    - **Missing Fields**: If a field mentioned in the import file does not exist in the catalog, ensure that the field is created first before importing the configuration.
