### 1. Keyword Suggestions

**What it does:**

This feature shows innovative keyword suggestions as users type in the search box. Powered by Unbxd’s algorithm, it pulls relevant terms from your product catalog, even for uncommon or new queries. It’s beneficial for new customers who don’t have a search history, ensuring they still get helpful suggestions.\
Generates intelligent suggestions from your product catalog based on attributes like `brand`, `category`, or `color`. These appear as users begin typing their query, ensuring suggestions even for less frequent or new searches.

**How to use:**

- Select the attributes you'd like to use for keyword suggestions.
- You can choose individual fields (e.g., `color`) or combinations (e.g., `brand + category`).
- Use the dropdown under **Select attribute** to add more fields.

> **Example:** If a user types "red", suggestions like _red dress_ or _red \+ category_ will be shown based on the selected attributes.

### 2. Infield Suggestions

**What it does:**\
Displays product segments or categories directly in the suggestion dropdown based on what the shopper types.

**How to use:**

- Select catalog attributes that define meaningful product groupings (e.g., `category`, `brand`).
- Use the same dropdown to add more segment types as needed.

> **Example:** Typing "Nike" might show “Nike Shoes” or “Nike Accessories” depending on available segments.
