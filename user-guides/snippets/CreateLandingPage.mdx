### Create Landing Pages (Optional)

Landing Pages are dedicated custom results pages built for specific queries. Merchandiser-driven landing pages offer full control, letting you access your entire catalog, override algorithms, and curate the search results using merchandising strategies.

- To create landing pages, toggle the option to green. Once enabled, the preview section will display all the products in your catalog.

- If you prefer to add customizations on top of the search results produced by Netcore Unbxd AI and don't want to access your complete catalog, you can proceed without enabling the Landing Page option (keep it in its default disabled state).

### Associate Collections (Optional)

You can use Collections to associate a curated product set with the landing page by selecting one or multiple Collections from the drop-down menu. You can create new ones by clicking \+ Create New Collection.

- After associating Collections with the landing page, the preview will update to display only the products included in the selected Collections
