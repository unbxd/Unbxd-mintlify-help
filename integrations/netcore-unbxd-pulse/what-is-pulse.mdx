## What is Pulse?

<Note>
  The Netcore Unbxd Pulse is a JavaScript snippet added to your website to
  capture anonymous data on user interactions. This data is sent to our servers,
  where it fuels Unbxdâ€™s AI models, enhancing your shoppersâ€™ ability to find the
  products theyâ€™re looking for.
</Note>

Netcore Unbxd Pulse is engineered to function without impacting site performance. It operates efficiently, utilizing event listeners to track shopper activity without interfering with the browserâ€™s event loop.

## Why is Netcore Unbxd Pulse the Preferred Integration Method?

### Simplified Ownership

With other methods, customers bear the responsibility of integrating analytics, often requiring extensive support. Netcore Unbxd Pulse shifts this responsibility to us, requiring you to only include a single line of code on your website.

### Faster Integration

The traditional integration process is often delayed by roadblocks customers face during implementation, leading to analytics not being ready even after going live. With Netcore Unbxd Pulse, the integration process is drastically shortened, targeting completion within a couple of days.

### Enhanced Post-Go-Live Experience

Netcore Unbxd Pulse proactively addresses issues with broken analytics after going live. If analytics fails for specific metrics, an alert banner will appear in the Console, and our support team will be notified automatically. The support team will proactively resolve the issue and redeploy the analytics script without your intervention.

### Integration Code

<CodeGroup>
  ```html Add Pulse Script
  <script
    type="text/javascript"
    defer
    charset="utf-8"
    src="https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/sdk-clients/PROD_SITEKEY/ua/ua.js"
  ></script>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  {" "}
  - **Defer Attribute**: The use of the `defer` attribute is to load the script in
  parallel with HTML parsing, ensuring the script executes only after the HTML is
  fully parsed. This improves the load performance of the page. - For Netcore Unbxd
  Pulse to function effectively, you may need to add specific HTML attributes for
  each document/event type. Related info can be found in the event documentation.{" "}

## How to Check if Event Payload Data is Retrieved?

Netcore Unbxd Pulse can retrieve payload data from multiple sources, such as DOM, URL, or browser windows.

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of how certain events are tracked.
