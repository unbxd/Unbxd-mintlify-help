title: API-based Implementation of Netcore Unbxd Analytics
sidebarTitle: How to?
---

<Info> Integration method recommended by Netcore Unbxd onboarding experts.</Info>

One of the ways you can implement Netcore Unbxd Analytics is with the help of APIs. Our API provides effortless, anonymous tracking of visitor behavior, enabling personalized search and category page results based on individual preferences. Additionally, the API powers comprehensive, site-level reporting.

## Things to Do Before API (GET) Integration (Prerequisites)
<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the common and event-specific attributes">
  
  To ensure a successful API implementation, it's essential to cross-verify or create the necessary attributes. You can get a detailed understanding of the API call here. These attributes fall into two categories:
  
  - **Common Attributes**: Applied universally across all events and critical for consistent tracking (e.g., `user ID`, `timestamp`).
  - **Event-Specific Attributes**: Unique to individual events, capturing details specific to an interaction (e.g., `product ID` for click events).

  <Note>
  Both common and event-specific attributes are mandatory. Attribute names and types must EXACTLY match those provided in the documentation.
</Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Autosuggest attributes">

  If your autosuggest widget is powered by Netcore Unbxd, then you’ll have to fire a few additional events. These will help improve autosuggest accuracy and provide necessary reports.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pass the Request with the Following HTTP Headers">

   | Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | Significance                                                                 |
   | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `user-agent`      | Browser identification information is passed to the webserver with every HTTPS request.                                                                                       | If not passed, device-based merchandising campaigns will not work.           |
   | `X-Forwarded-For` | Signifies the IP address of the end-user. This is required primarily if the integration is a backend process since Unbxd doesn’t get the IP of the end-user from the browser. | If not passed, segmentation, A/B testing, and personalization will not work. |
 
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens in the API call?

Example API URL:

<Info>
The query string following the `?` includes various parameters needed to track a search event. Each of these parameters is a key-value pair separated by `&`.
</Info>

```
https://tracker.unbxdapi.com/v2/1p.jpg
?data={"pid":"{{uniqueId-of-the-product}}",
"url":"{{url-of-the-website}}",
"referrer":”{{reference-link}}”,
"visit_type":"{{first_or_repeat}}",
"visitId":"{{visit-id}}"}
&UnbxdKey={{unbxd-sitekey}}
&action=click&uid={uid}}&t=1662365583875|0.7442797542869459
```

**Endpoint:** `http://tracker.unbxdapi.com/v2/1p.jpg`

- Endpoint: This is the URL that the request is sent to. It represents a specific API resource that processes tracking data.
- The image file `.jpg` serves as a tracking pixel, used to capture the visitor’s data while maintaining anonymity.

<Note>
Understand the required parameters, their values, and purpose from this section.
</Note>

#### How the API Works
- Endpoint: The request is made to `http://tracker.unbxdapi.com/v2/1p.jpg`.
- Parameters:
  - The `data` parameter contains information about the search query, the page URL, the referrer, and the session.
  - The `UnbxdKey` associates the request with the correct Unbxd account.
  - The `action` specifies that this request is for tracking a search event.
  - The `uid` and `t` parameters track the user and the timestamp, respectively.

Each parameter provides essential context about the user’s interaction with the site and ensures the right data is tracked for analytics purposes.
